Clone any website with one command using AI coding agents

## installation

> **Important:** Start by making your own copy with GitHub's **Use this template** button. Do not clone this template repository directly for your website project, and do not open pull requests here with your generated website.

1. **Create your own repository from this template**

   On the GitHub page for this project, click **Use this template**, then click **Create a new repository**.

   Give your new repository a name, choose whether it should be public or private, then click **Create repository**. If GitHub shows an **Include all branches** option, you can leave it off.

   This gives you your own separate project to work in, so your website changes stay in your account instead of coming back to the main template.

2. **Open your new repository on your computer**

   After GitHub creates your copy, open that new repository. Click **Code** and open or clone your new repository with your preferred coding tool.

   If you use the terminal, the command will look like this:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-NEW-REPOSITORY.git
   cd YOUR-NEW-REPOSITORY
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Start your AI agent** — Claude Code recommended:
   ```bash
   claude --chrome
   ```
5. **Run the skill**:
   ```
   /clone-website <target-url1> [<target-url2> ...]
   ```
6. **Customize** (optional) — after the base clone is built, modify as needed

> Most supported clients expose `/clone-website` directly. If your client activates skills from natural-language requests, enter `Clone <target-url> using the clone-website workflow`. Project instructions are in `AGENTS.md`.

# ahujasid/blender-mcp

Community plugin to control Blender 3D with any LLM of your choice

## installation

Three steps: install `uv`, point your MCP client at the server, install the Blender addon.

**1. Install uv**

```bash
# macOS
brew install uv

# Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

> **Warning:** Do not proceed before installing uv. Use the official installer — *not* `pip install uv`.

**2. Add the MCP server to your client**

<details open>
<summary><b>Claude Desktop</b> — Settings → Developer → Edit Config</summary>

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "blender": {
            "command": "uvx",
            "args": ["blender-mcp"]
        }
    }
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Claude Code</b></summary>

```bash
claude mcp add blender uvx blender-mcp
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Cursor / VS Code / OpenCode</b></summary>

See [MCP Client Setup](#mcp-client-setup) below for per-client instructions and one-click install buttons.
</details>

**3. Install the Blender addon**

```bash
uvx blender-mcp install-addon
```

Then in Blender: **Edit → Preferences → Add-ons** → enable **Interface: Blender MCP**.

**4. Connect**

In Blender's 3D viewport, press `N` → open the **BlenderMCP** tab → click **Start MCP Server**. That's it — ask Claude to build something.

> **Note:** Only run **one** instance of the MCP server (either Cursor or Claude Desktop), not both.

## features

| | |
|---|---|
| **Two-way communication** | Connect Claude AI to Blender through a socket-based server |
| **Object manipulation** | Create, modify, and delete 3D objects in Blender |
| **Material control** | Apply and modify materials and colors |
| **Scene inspection** | Get detailed information about the current Blender scene |
| **Code execution** | Run arbitrary Python code in Blender from Claude |
| **Asset & model generation** | Poly Haven assets, Sketchfab models, and AI-generated 3D models via Hyper3D Rodin and Hunyuan3D |

## Components

The system consists of two main components:

1. **Blender Addon** (`addon.py`) — a Blender addon that creates a socket server within Blender to receive and execute commands
2. **MCP Server** (`src/blender_mcp/server.py`) — a Python server that implements the Model Context Protocol and connects to the Blender addon

---

## requirements

- **Blender** 3.0 or newer
- **Python** 3.10 or newer
- **uv** package manager

<details>
<summary><b>Installing uv, per platform</b></summary>

**macOS**
```bash
brew install uv
```

**Windows**
```powershell
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Then add uv to the user path in Windows (you may need to restart Claude Desktop after):

```powershell
$localBin = "$env:USERPROFILE\.local\bin"
$userPath = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "User")
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$userPath;$localBin", "User")
```

**Linux**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

It lands in `~/.local/bin` — open a new shell so it's on your PATH.

Otherwise, installation instructions are on their website: [Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

On every OS, use uv's **official installer above — not `pip install uv`**, which may not create the `uvx` command and can hide uv inside an environment your client can't see.
</details>

> **Warning:** Do not proceed before installing uv.

### Make your client find uvx

MCP clients started from a GUI (Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code from the Dock/Start menu) do **not** inherit your terminal's PATH, so a bare `"command": "uvx"` can fail with **`spawn uvx ENOENT`** even though `uvx` works in your terminal. If that happens:

- Find uvx's full path — `which uvx` (macOS/Linux) or `where uvx` (Windows) — and use it as `"command"`, e.g. `/opt/homebrew/bin/uvx` or `C:\Users\<you>\.local\bin\uvx.exe`.
- On Windows you can instead wrap it: `"command": "cmd", "args": ["/c", "uvx", "blender-mcp"]`.
- After any PATH or config change, **fully quit and relaunch** the client (Windows: quit from the system tray, not just the window; macOS: <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd>).

### Pin the Python version

*Avoid conda / pyenv / version conflicts.*

uv chooses which Python runs the server. On machines with conda (auto-activated base), pyenv, or asdf — or with a newer CPython release that some dependencies do not have wheels for yet — uv can grab an interpreter that makes installation fail. Pin Python 3.11 and prefer uv-managed interpreters to avoid using whatever is on your PATH:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "blender": {
            "command": "uvx",
            "args": ["--python", "3.11", "blender-mcp"],
            "env": { "UV_PYTHON_PREFERENCE": "only-managed" }
        }
    }
}
```

`--python 3.11` still satisfies this package's `requires-python >=3.10`, and `UV_PYTHON_PREFERENCE=only-managed` keeps uv from selecting conda, pyenv, asdf, or system Python first. (The repo's `.python-version` is only a hint for contributors and does **not** affect `uvx`.)

If a previous failed attempt keeps replaying after a fix, clear the cache:

```bash
uv cache clean blender-mcp && uvx --refresh blender-mcp
```

## configuration

The following environment variables can be used to configure the Blender connection:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `BLENDER_HOST` | `localhost` | Host address for Blender socket server |
| `BLENDER_PORT` | `9876` | Port number for Blender socket server |

Example:

```bash
export BLENDER_HOST='host.docker.internal'
export BLENDER_PORT=9876
```

## tools

### Starting the Connection

![BlenderMCP in the sidebar](assets/addon-instructions.png)

1. In Blender, go to the 3D View sidebar (press <kbd>N</kbd> if not visible)
2. Find the **BlenderMCP** tab
3. Turn on the checkboxes you'd like to use (see more under [Capabilities](#capabilities) below)
4. Click **Connect to Claude**
5. Make sure the MCP server is running in your terminal

### Using with Claude

Once the config file has been set on Claude, and the addon is running on Blender, you will see a hammer icon with tools for the Blender MCP.

## limitations

> **Warning:** The `execute_blender_code` tool allows running arbitrary Python code in Blender, which can be powerful but potentially dangerous. Use with caution in production environments. **ALWAYS save your work before using it.**

- Poly Haven requires downloading models, textures, and HDRI images. If you do not want to use it, please turn it off in the checkbox in Blender.
- Complex operations might need to be broken down into smaller steps.

## Telemetry Control

BlenderMCP collects anonymous usage data to help improve the tool. Telemetry consent is **on by default**, and you can turn it off in two ways:

**1. In Blender** — go to **Edit → Preferences → Add-ons → Blender MCP** and uncheck the telemetry consent checkbox.

- With consent (checked, the default): view the TnC for more details on data collected.

**2. Environment Variable** — completely disable all telemetry by running:

```bash
DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true uvx blender-mcp
```

Or add it to your MCP config:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "blender": {
            "command": "uvx",
            "args": ["blender-mcp"],
            "env": {
                "DISABLE_TELEMETRY": "true"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Telemetry data is not linked to your name or account. It may be used to improve BlenderMCP, for research, and to train AI models.

Full detail on what is collected, and the license you grant by leaving telemetry on, is in [TERMS_AND_CONDITIONS.md](TERMS_AND_CONDITIONS.md).

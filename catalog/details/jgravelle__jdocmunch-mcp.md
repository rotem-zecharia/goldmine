# jgravelle/jdocmunch-mcp

The leading, most token-efficient MCP server for documentation exploration and retrieval via structured section indexing

## features

**The problem.** An agent asked "how do I configure authentication?" opens a documentation file, skims hundreds of paragraphs it does not need, opens another, and repeats. Large context windows do not fix this. They just make the waste affordable enough to ignore until the bill arrives, and they crowd out the context the model actually needed.

**The mechanism.** jDocMunch parses a documentation set into a section tree keyed by heading hierarchy, stores each section's byte offsets into the original file, and exposes retrieval over MCP. Sections keep durable identities across re-indexing as long as path, heading text, and heading level are unchanged.

**The outcome.** The unit of access changes from *file* to *section*. An agent retrieves the installation section, one configuration block, or a specific heading subtree — and nothing else.

## What makes it different

### Section-first retrieval
Search and retrieve documentation by section, not just file path or keyword match.

### Byte-precise extraction
Full content is pulled on demand from exact byte offsets into the original file.

### Stable section IDs
Sections retain durable identities across re-indexing when path, heading text, and heading level remain unchanged.

## Evidence

Four benchmarks against public documentation corpora, each with the corpus, date, and per-query results recorded in [`benchmarks/`](benchmarks/).

| Corpus | Scale | Indexed in | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Kubernetes](benchmarks/jDocMunch_Benchmark_Kubernetes.md) (`kubernetes/website`, 2026-03-04) | 1,569 `.md` files, 4,355 sections, 16 MB | 3,352 ms | 27,285 tokens saved on a single node-affinity query; 100 ms latency |
| [SciPy](benchmarks/jDocMunch_Benchmark_SciPy.md) | 10,402 sections, ~855,000 corpus tokens | 2,247 ms | 135–152 ms per query across sparse-solver, FFT, and optimization lookups |
| [LangChain](benchmarks/jDocMunch_Benchmark_LangChain_MDX.md) (MDX) | 5,973 sections | 5,204 ms | MDX-aware sectioning found 754% more sections than the naive pass |
| [Wiki](benchmarks/jDocMunch_Benchmark_Wiki.md) | 7,449-token corpus | — | Search returns ranked metadata in ~190 tokens against a 7,449-token whole-corpus read |

**Read these as per-corpus results, not as a single headline multiple.** Savings depend on how large the containing file is relative to the section you needed: a small file with one heading saves almost nothing, and the Kubernetes corpus saves a great deal. The benchmark files record the queries that did poorly alongside the ones that did well.

A separate, measured result from the [v1.121.0](CHANGELOG.md) projection work, on this repository's own docs at `max_results=10`: a search row went **1,989 chars → 319 with `compact=true` (−84%)**, or 431 with `snippet_bytes=200` (−78%) while removing the follow-up `get_section` call entirely.

**Retrieval quality is gated, not assumed.** Every release runs a replay fixture over a frozen golden set and fails below **nDCG 0.95**. That gate has failed builds and blocked releases; it is not decorative.

## installation

**Requirements:** Python 3.10+, any MCP-compatible client.

```bash
uv tool install jdocmunch-mcp
jdocmunch-mcp init
```

No virtualenv to manage, nothing written into system Python, and it works as-is on PEP 668 distros (Ubuntu 24.04+, Debian 12+) where bare `pip install` is refused. [Don't have `uv` yet?](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

`init` detects your MCP clients, writes their config entries, installs the doc-exploration prompt policy so your agent actually reaches for the tools, and optionally installs hooks and indexes your docs.

<details>
<summary><b>Other install paths</b></summary>

| Command | Use it when |
|---|---|
| `uvx jdocmunch-mcp` | **Zero install.** Runs from an ephemeral environment — nothing lands on disk permanently. The client entries `init` writes already invoke the server this way, so for most setups this is all that ever runs. ⚠ Hooks are the exception: they're spawned by a minimal-PATH subshell and resolve the executable by name, so they need `uv tool install` (or `pipx`/`pip`) to work. |
| `pipx install jdocmunch-mcp` | You already standardise on pipx |
| `pip install jdocmunch-mcp` | Inside a virtualenv you manage yourself |

</details>

Verify:

```bash
jdocmunch-mcp --version
```

**Manual Claude Code setup:**

```bash
claude mcp add -s user jdocmunch -- uvx jdocmunch-mcp
```

No install step — `uvx` fetches and runs the server on demand. Prefer it on your PATH (and required for hooks)? `uv tool install jdocmunch-mcp`, then `claude mcp add -s user jdocmunch jdocmunch-mcp`.

Installing the server makes the tools available; it does not break an agent's habit of brute-reading files. One line in your `CLAUDE.md` does that:

```markdown
Call the jdocmunch_guide tool and strictly follow its instructions.
```

## Quickstart

**Assumes:** jDocMunch installed and registered with your client, and a folder of documentation.

Index a local documentation folder:

```bash
jdocmunch-mcp index-local --path ./docs
```

It prints JSON naming the corpus and what it found:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "repo": "local/docs",
  "file_count": 1,
  "section_count": 4,
  "doc_types": { ".md": 1 },
  "semantic_search": false
}
```

`section_count` greater than `file_count` is the whole point: the index addresses headings, not files.

Then, inside your agent:

> Using jdocmunch, search the docs for "authentication configuration" and show me that section.

The agent should call `search_sections`, then `get_section` on the top hit — returning one section rather than a file. `_meta.tokens_saved` on the response reports what that cost versus reading the containing document.

**Next step:** `get_toc_tree` for a structural view of the whole corpus, or `index_repo` to index documentation straight from a GitHub repository.

## What you can do

- **Retrieve one section instead of a document.** `get_section` and `get_sections` pull byte-precise content from the original file; `get_section_excerpt` narrows further.
- **Search by meaning, not just keywords.** `search_sections` fuses BM25 with semantic cosine when an embedding provider is configured. `compact=true`, `fields=[...]`, and `snippet_bytes=N` cut the response further.
- **Navigate structure.** `get_toc`, `get_toc_tree`, `get_section_path`, `get_section_descendants`, and `section_neighbors` traverse the heading tree without reading content.
- **Find what documentation is missing or rotting.** `get_doc_coverage`, `get_undocumented_symbols`, `get_stale_pages`, `get_orphan_sections`, `get_broken_links`, and `doc_health_radar`.
- **Work across API specs.** `find_endpoint`, `list_endpoints_by_tag`, `find_operations_using_schema`, and `get_schema_graph` treat OpenAPI documents as first-class.
- **Preflight documentation changes.** `check_section_delete_safe` and `get_section_blast_radius` before you remove or restructure.
- **Know when an answer is stale.** Content reads disclose `_meta.freshness`, `_meta.verdict`, and which source layer an

## limitations

- **Section retrieval helps least on small files.** If a document has one heading and 40 lines, retrieving the section and reading the file cost about the same.
- **Semantic search requires an embedding provider.** Without one, search is lexical only — good for identifiers and exact phrasing, weaker for paraphrased questions.
- **Office formats need the optional `[office]` extra** and are supported for local indexing only.
- **Freshness is disclosed, not guaranteed.** A section whose source cannot be checked is reported as `unknown` rather than assumed current.
- **jDocMunch does not parse code.** Symbols, signatures, and call graphs belong to [jcodemunch-mcp](https://github.com/jgravelle/jcodemunch-mcp); tabular data belongs to [jdatamunch-mcp](https://github.com/jgravelle/jdatamunch-mcp).

### 1.x compatibility commitment

Every 1.x license entitles you to every future 1.x release. We will never ship a 1.x version that:

- removes or renames an MCP tool (deprecated tool names keep their aliases),
- drops a `Section` field from the response shape,
- forces a reindex without auto-migrating your existing index on first load,
- changes the JSON wire format of any tool response in a way that breaks an existing consumer,
- or makes a previously-default behavior raise.

Anything that would require breaking these promises is reserved for a future major version (2.x). The full machine-checked contract is enforced via `tests/test_server.py` (tool-name and required-field invariants) and the replay-fixture gate that runs on every release.

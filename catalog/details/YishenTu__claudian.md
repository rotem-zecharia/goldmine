# YishenTu/claudian

An Obsidian plugin that embeds Claude Code/Codex as an AI collaborator in your vault

## features

Open the chat sidebar from the ribbon icon or command palette. Select text and use the hotkey for inline edit. Everything works like your familiar coding agent, Claude Code, Codex, Grok, Opencode, and Pi — talk to the agent, and it reads, writes, edits, and searches files in your vault.

**Inline Edit** — Select text or start at the cursor position + hotkey to edit directly in notes with word-level diff preview.

**Slash Commands & Skills** — Type `/` or `$` for reusable prompt templates or Skills from user- and vault-level scopes.

**`@mention`** - Type `@` to mention anything you want the agent to work with, including vault files, subagents, and files in external directories.

**Plan Mode** — Toggle via `Shift+Tab`. The agent explores and designs before implementing, then presents a plan for approval.

**Instruction Mode (`/instruction`)** — Refined custom instructions added from the chat input.

**MCP Servers** — Connect external tools through each coding agent's native CLI-managed MCP configuration.

**Tabs & Session Management** — Use multiple tabs in single-panel mode or a persistent session manager beside the chat in dual-pane mode.

**Collab Mode** — Collaborate on shared projects with other Claudian users. [Learn more](https://claudian.md/docs/collab-mode/).

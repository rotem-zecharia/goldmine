# smallstep/certificates

🛡️ A private certificate authority (X.509 & SSH) & ACME server for secure automated certificate management, so you can use TLS everywhere & SSO for SSH.

## features

### 🦾 A fast, stable, flexible private CA

Setting up a *public key infrastructure* (PKI) is out of reach for many small teams. `step-ca` makes it easier.

- Choose key types (RSA, ECDSA, EdDSA) and lifetimes to suit your needs
- [Short-lived certificates](https://smallstep.com/blog/passive-revocation.html) with automated enrollment, renewal, and passive revocation
- Can operate as [an online intermediate CA for an existing root CA](https://smallstep.com/docs/tutorials/intermediate-ca-new-ca)
- [Badger, BoltDB, Postgres, and MySQL database backends](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-ca/configuration#databases)

### ⚙️ Many ways to automate

There are several ways to authorize a request with the CA and establish a chain of trust that suits your flow.

You can issue certificates in exchange for:
- [ACME challenge responses](#your-own-private-acme-server) from any ACMEv2 client
- [OAuth OIDC single sign-on tokens](https://smallstep.com/blog/easily-curl-services-secured-by-https-tls.html), eg:
  - ID tokens from Okta, GSuite, Azure AD, Auth0.
  - ID tokens from an OAuth OIDC service that you host, like [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) or [Dex](https://github.com/dexidp/dex)
- [Cloud instance identity documents](https://smallstep.com/blog/embarrassingly-easy-certificates-on-aws-azure-gcp/), for VMs on AWS, GCP, and Azure
- [Single-use, short-lived JWK tokens](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-ca/provisioners#jwk) issued by your CD tool — Puppet, Chef, Ansible, Terraform, etc.
- A trusted X.509 certificate (X5C provisioner)
- A host certificate from your Nebula network
- A SCEP challenge (SCEP provisioner)
- An SSH host certificates needing renewal (the SSHPOP provisioner)

### 🏔 Your own private ACME server

ACME is the protocol used by Let's Encrypt to automate the issuance of HTTPS certificates. It's _super easy_ to issue certificates to any ACMEv2 ([RFC8555](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8555)) client.

- [Use ACME in development & pre-production](https://smallstep.com/blog/private-acme-server/#local-development--pre-production)
- Supports the most popular [ACME challenge types](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/):
  - For `http-01`, place a token at a well-known URL to prove that you control the web server
  - For `dns-01`, add a `TXT` record to prove that you control the DNS record set
  - For `tls-alpn-01`, respond to the challenge at the TLS layer ([as Caddy does](https://caddy.community/t/caddy-supports-the-acme-tls-alpn-challenge/4860)) to prove that you control the web server

- Works with any ACME client. We've written examples for:
  - [certbot](https://smallstep.com/docs/tutorials/acme-protocol-acme-clients#certbot)
  - [acme.sh](https://smallstep.com/docs/tutorials/acme-protocol-acme-clients#acmesh)
  - [win-acme](https://smallstep.com/docs/tutorials/acme-protocol-acme-clients#win-acme)
  - [Caddy](https://smallstep.com/docs/tutorials/acme-protocol-acme-clients#caddy-v2)
  - [Traefik](https://smallstep.com/docs/tutorials/acme-protocol-acme-clients#traefik)
  - [Apache](https://smallstep.com/docs/tutorials/acme-protocol-acme-clients#apache)
  - [nginx](https://smallstep.com/docs/tutorials/acme-protocol-acme-clients#nginx)
- Get certificates programmatically using ACME, using these libraries:
  - [`lego`](https://github.com/go-acme/lego) for Golang ([example usage](https://smallstep.com/docs/tutorials/acme-protocol-acme-clients#golang))
  - certbot's [`acme` module](https://github.com/certbot/certbot/tree/master/acme) for Python ([example usage](https://smallstep.com/docs/tutorials/acme-protocol-acme-clients#python))
  - [`acme-client`](https://github.com/publishlab/node-acme-client) for Node.js ([example usage](https://smallstep.com/docs/tutorials/acme-protocol-acme-clients#node))
- Our own [`step` CLI tool](https://github.com/smallstep/cli) is also an ACME client!
- See our [ACME tutorial](https://smallstep.co

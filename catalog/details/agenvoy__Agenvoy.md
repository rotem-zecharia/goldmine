# agenvoy/Agenvoy

Self-hosted AI agent harness in a single Go binary — writes, sandbox-tests and repairs its own tools, and lets Claude Code, Codex and any MCP client build and share them.

## features

- **Self-extending tools** — builds the missing tool instead of stopping
- **One sandboxed tool library** — shared across Agenvoy, Claude Code, Codex, and more
- **Self-hosted execution** — scheduling, memory, and file search on your own machine
- **Agent app and MCP server** — the same binary is both

## What you can do with it

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### Ask for live answers

> What's the weather in Taipei?
>
> The agent finds current data, calls tools, and gives you the answer.
>
> If a tool doesn't exist, it builds one.

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### Turn one sentence into automation

> Report TSMC stock price every morning at 8am
>
> The agent asks:
>
> - Where to push results
> - What format you want
> - When to run
>
> Then creates the schedule automatically.

### Ask your local files questions

> Find all invoices from last year
>
> Which document mentions Prompt guide?
>
> The agent searches your local files and answers directly.

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### Finish multi-step work

> Summarize today's GitHub commits and generate a progress report
>
> The agent breaks down the task, calls tools, combines results, and replies.

### Works with the agents you already use

> Agenvoy is also an MCP server.
>
> Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and other AI agents can connect and:
>
> - Use all your sandboxed tools
> - Auto-build new tools when none exist
> - Share every tool across all agents
>
> One line of config. Instant shared tool library.
> Tools created in the demo: [`fetch_weather`](doc/demo/fetch_weather/) · [`fetch_crypto_price`](doc/demo/fetch_crypto_price/)

## Who it's for

Agenvoy is for developers, technical operators, and AI-heavy workflows that need more than chat:

- People who want a self-hosted agent with sandbox guardrails
- Teams that want reusable tools across agents
- Users who need automation, file search, and scheduled reporting in one place

## Developer Recommendations

A cost-effective model setup to get started:

- Apply for a free **[NVIDIA NIM](https://build.nvidia.com/explore/discover)** API token, then use it for:
  - `gpt-oss-20b` as the **dispatcher** model
  - `gpt-oss-120b` as the **fallback** and **summary** model
- Use a subscription plan as your **primary** model:
  - OpenAI ChatGPT Plus ($20/mo)
  - SuperGrok ($30/mo)

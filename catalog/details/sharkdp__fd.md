# sharkdp/fd

A simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to 'find'

## features

* Intuitive syntax: `fd PATTERN` instead of `find -iname '*PATTERN*'`.
* Regular expression (default) and glob-based patterns.
* [Very fast](#benchmark) due to parallelized directory traversal.
* Uses colors to highlight different file types (same as `ls`).
* Supports [parallel command execution](#command-execution)
* Smart case: the search is case-insensitive by default. It switches to
  case-sensitive if the pattern contains an uppercase
  character[\*](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html#'smartcase').
* Ignores hidden directories and files, by default.
* Ignores patterns from your `.gitignore`, by default.
* The command name is *50%* shorter[\*](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) than
  `find` :-).

## How to use

First, to get an overview of all available command line options, you can either run
[`fd -h`](#command-line-options) for a concise help message or `fd --help` for a more detailed
version.

### Simple search

*fd* is designed to find entries in your filesystem. The most basic search you can perform is to
run *fd* with a single argument: the search pattern. For example, assume that you want to find an
old script of yours (the name included `netflix`):
``` bash
> fd netfl
Software/python/imdb-ratings/netflix-details.py
```
If called with just a single argument like this, *fd* searches the current directory recursively
for any entries that *contain* the pattern `netfl`.

### Regular expression search

The search pattern is treated as a regular expression. Here, we search for entries that start
with `x` and end with `rc`:
``` bash
> cd /etc
> fd '^x.*rc$'
X11/xinit/xinitrc
X11/xinit/xserverrc
```

The regular expression syntax used by `fd` is [documented here](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#syntax).

### Specifying the root directory

If we want to search a specific directory, it can be given as a second argument to *fd*:
``` bash
> fd passwd /etc
/etc/default/passwd
/etc/pam.d/passwd
/etc/passwd
```

### List all files, recursively

*fd* can be called with no arguments. This is very useful to get a quick overview of all entries
in the current directory, recursively (similar to `ls -R`):
``` bash
> cd fd/tests
> fd
testenv
testenv/mod.rs
tests.rs
```

If you want to use this functionality to list all files in a given directory, you have to use
a catch-all pattern such as `.` or `^`:
``` bash
> fd . fd/tests/
testenv
testenv/mod.rs
tests.rs
```

### Searching for a particular file extension

Often, we are interested in all files of a particular type. This can be done with the `-e` (or
`--extension`) option. Here, we search for all Markdown files in the fd repository:
``` bash
> cd fd
> fd -e md
CONTRIBUTING.md
README.md
```

The `-e` option can be used in combination with a search pattern:
``` bash
> fd -e rs mod
src/fshelper/mod.rs
src/lscolors/mod.rs
tests/testenv/mod.rs
```

### Searching for a particular file name

 To find files with exactly the provided search pattern, use the `-g` (or `--glob`) option:
``` bash
> fd -g libc.so /usr
/usr/lib32/libc.so
/usr/lib/libc.so
```

### Hidden and ignored files
By default, *fd* does not search hidden directories and does not show hidden files in the
search results. To disable this behavior, we can use the `-H` (or `--hidden`) option:
``` bash
> fd pre-commit
> fd -H pre-commit
.git/hooks/pre-commit.sample
```

If we work in a directory that is a Git repository (or includes Git repositories), *fd* does not
search folders (and does not show files) that match one of the `.gitignore` patterns. To disable
this behavior, we can use the `-I` (or `--no-ignore`) option:
``` bash
> fd num_cpu
> fd -I num_cpu
target/debug/deps/libnum_cpus-f5ce7ef99006aa05.rlib
```

To really search *all* files and directories, simply combine the hidden and ignore features to show
everything (`-HI`) or use `-u`/`--unrestricted`.

### Matching the full path
By default, *fd* only matches the filename of each file. However, using the `-

## configuration

This is the output of `fd -h`. To see the full set of command-line options, use `fd --help` which
also includes a much more detailed help text.

## Benchmark

Let's search my home folder for files that end in `[0-9].jpg`. It contains ~750,000
subdirectories and about a 4 million files. For averaging and statistical analysis, I'm using
[hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine). The following benchmarks are performed
with a "warm"/pre-filled disk-cache (results for a "cold" disk-cache show the same trends).

Let's start with `find`:
```
Benchmark 1: find ~ -iregex '.*[0-9]\.jpg$'
  Time (mean ± σ):     19.922 s ±  0.109 s
  Range (min … max):   19.765 s … 20.065 s
```

`find` is much faster if it does not need to perform a regular-expression search:
```
Benchmark 2: find ~ -iname '*[0-9].jpg'
  Time (mean ± σ):     11.226 s ±  0.104 s
  Range (min … max):   11.119 s … 11.466 s
```

Now let's try the same for `fd`. Note that `fd` performs a regular expression
search by default. The options `-u`/`--unrestricted` option is needed here for
a fair comparison. Otherwise `fd` does not have to traverse hidden folders and
ignored paths (see below):
```
Benchmark 3: fd -u '[0-9]\.jpg$' ~
  Time (mean ± σ):     854.8 ms ±  10.0 ms
  Range (min … max):   839.2 ms … 868.9 ms
```
For this particular example, `fd` is approximately **23 times faster** than `find -iregex`
and about **13 times faster** than `find -iname`. By the way, both tools found the exact
same 546 files :smile:.

# thedotmack/claude-mem

Persistent Context Across Sessions for Every Agent – Captures everything your agent does during sessions, compresses it with AI, and injects relevant context back into future sessions. Works with Clau

## installation

Install with a single command:

```bash
npx claude-mem install
```

Or install for OpenCode:

```bash
npx claude-mem install --ide opencode
```

Or install for Antigravity CLI ([setup guide](https://docs.claude-mem.ai/antigravity-cli/setup)):

```bash
npx claude-mem install --ide antigravity
```

Or install from the plugin marketplace inside Claude Code:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add thedotmack/claude-mem

/plugin install claude-mem
```

Restart Claude Code. Context from previous sessions will automatically appear in new sessions.

> **Note:** Claude-Mem is also published on npm, but `npm install -g claude-mem` installs the **SDK/library only** — it does not register the plugin hooks or set up the worker service. Always install via `npx claude-mem install` or the `/plugin` commands above.

## tools

Claude-Mem provides intelligent memory search through **4 MCP tools** following a token-efficient **3-layer workflow pattern**:

**The 3-Layer Workflow:**

1. **`search`** - Get compact index with IDs (~50-100 tokens/result)
2. **`timeline`** - Get chronological context around interesting results
3. **`get_observations`** - Fetch full details ONLY for filtered IDs (~500-1,000 tokens/result)

**How It Works:**
- Claude uses MCP tools to search your memory
- Start with `search` to get an index of results
- Use `timeline` to see what was happening around specific observations
- Use `get_observations` to fetch full details for relevant IDs
- **~10x token savings** by filtering before fetching details

**Available MCP Tools:**

1. **`search`** - Search memory index with full-text queries, filters by type/date/project
2. **`timeline`** - Get chronological context around a specific observation or query
3. **`get_observations`** - Fetch full observation details by IDs (always batch multiple IDs)

**Example Usage:**

```typescript
// Step 1: Search for index
search(query="authentication bug", type="bugfix", limit=10)

// Step 2: Review index, identify relevant IDs (e.g., #123, #456)

// Step 3: Fetch full details
get_observations(ids=[123, 456])
```

See [Search Tools Guide](https://docs.claude-mem.ai/usage/search-tools) for detailed examples.

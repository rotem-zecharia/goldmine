## installation

### CloudCLI Cloud (Recommended)

The fastest way to get started — no local setup required. Get a fully managed, containerized development environment accessible from the web, mobile app, API, or your favorite IDE.

**[Get started with CloudCLI Cloud](https://cloudcli.ai)**

### Self-Hosted (Open source)

#### npm

Try CloudCLI UI instantly with **npx** (requires **Node.js** v22+):

```
npx @cloudcli-ai/cloudcli
```

Or install **globally** for regular use:

```
npm install -g @cloudcli-ai/cloudcli
cloudcli
```

Open `http://localhost:3001` — all your existing sessions are discovered automatically.

Visit the **[documentation →](https://cloudcli.ai/docs)** for full configuration options, PM2, remote server setup and more.

#### Docker Sandboxes (Experimental)

Run agents in isolated sandboxes with hypervisor-level isolation. Starts Claude Code by default. Requires the [`sbx` CLI](https://docs.docker.com/ai/sandboxes/get-started/).

```
npx @cloudcli-ai/cloudcli@latest sandbox ~/my-project
```

Supports Claude Code and Codex. See the [sandbox docs](../docker/) for setup and advanced options.

### Desktop Companion App

CloudCLI Desktop is an optional native companion for CloudCLI Cloud and Local CloudCLI. It ships from this repository's GitHub Releases and keeps CloudCLI available from your menu bar or tray.

- **[macOS](https://cloudcli.ai/download/macos)**
- **[Windows](https://cloudcli.ai/download/windows)**
- **[Download page](https://cloudcli.ai/download)** · **[GitHub Releases and checksums](https://github.com/siteboon/claudecodeui/releases)**

Use it to open CloudCLI Cloud environments, switch between local and remote workspaces, and copy mobile/browser URLs. To work locally, choose **Local CloudCLI** in the desktop app; it will use your running local server or start one for you.

## Which option is right for you?

CloudCLI UI is the open source UI layer that powers CloudCLI Cloud. You can self-host it on your own machine, run it in a Docker sandbox for isolation, or use CloudCLI Cloud for a fully managed environment.

| | Self-Hosted (npm) | Self-Hosted (Docker Sandbox) *(Experimental)* | CloudCLI Cloud |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Best for** | Local agent sessions on your own machine | Isolated agents with web/mobile IDE | Teams who want agents in the cloud |
| **How you access it** | Browser via `[yourip]:port` | Browser via `localhost:port` | Browser, any IDE, REST API, n8n |
| **Setup** | `npx @cloudcli-ai/cloudcli` | `npx @cloudcli-ai/cloudcli@latest sandbox ~/project` | No setup required |
| **Isolation** | Runs on your host | Hypervisor-level sandbox (microVM) | Full cloud isolation |
| **Machine needs to stay on** | Yes | Yes | No |
| **Mobile access** | Any browser on your network | Any browser on your network | Any device |
| **Desktop companion** | Optional. Choose Local CloudCLI | Optional. Choose Local CloudCLI | Optional. Opens cloud environments |
| **Agents supported** | Claude Code, Cursor CLI, Codex | Claude Code, Codex | Claude Code, Cursor CLI, Codex |
| **File explorer and Git** | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **MCP configuration** | Synced with `~/.claude` | Managed via UI | Managed via UI |
| **REST API** | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Team sharing** | No | No | Yes |
| **Platform cost** | Free, open source | Free, open source | Starts at €7/month |

> All options use your own AI subscriptions (Claude, Cursor, etc.) — CloudCLI provides the environment, not the AI.

## tools

**🔒 Important Notice**: All Claude Code tools are **disabled by default**. This prevents potentially harmful operations from running automatically.

### Enabling Tools

To use Claude Code's full functionality, you'll need to manually enable tools:

1. **Open Tools Settings** - Click the gear icon in the sidebar
2. **Enable Selectively** - Turn on only the tools you need
3. **Apply Settings** - Your preferences are saved locally

<div align="center">

![Tools Settings Modal](../public/screenshots/tools-modal.png)
*Tools Settings interface - enable only what you need*

</div>

**Recommended approach**: Start with basic tools enabled and add more as needed. You can always adjust these settings later.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>How is this different from Claude Code Remote Control?</summary>

Claude Code Remote Control lets you send messages to a session already running in your local terminal. Your machine has to stay on, your terminal has to stay open, and sessions time out after roughly 10 minutes without a network connection.

CloudCLI UI and CloudCLI Cloud extend Claude Code rather than sit alongside it — your MCP servers, permissions, settings, and sessions are the exact same ones Claude Code uses natively. Nothing is duplicated or managed separately.

Here's what that means in practice:

- **All your sessions, not just one** — CloudCLI UI auto-discovers every session from your `~/.claude` folder. Remote Control only exposes the single active session to make it available in the Claude mobile app.
- **Your settings are your settings** — MCP servers, tool permissions, and project config you change in CloudCLI UI are written directly to your Claude Code config and take effect immediately, and vice versa.
- **Works with more agents** — Claude Code, Cursor CLI and Code

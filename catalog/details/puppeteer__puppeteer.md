# puppeteer/puppeteer

JavaScript API for Chrome and Firefox

## installation

```bash npm2yarn
npm i puppeteer # Downloads compatible Chrome during installation.
npm i puppeteer-core # Alternatively, install as a library, without downloading Chrome.
```

:::note

Modern package managers (including npm (see the [RFC](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/868)), pnpm, Yarn, Bun, and Deno) block dependency install scripts by default. If the install script is blocked, Puppeteer will not download the browser during installation, leading to runtime errors.

You can manually download the required browsers after installation by running:

```bash npm2yarn
npx puppeteer browsers install
```

Alternatively, you can configure your package manager to allow the install script to run (for example, with npm, by adding `"puppeteer"` to `"allowScripts"` in your `package.json`).

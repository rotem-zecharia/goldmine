Deploy a Production Ready Kubernetes Cluster

## installation

Below are several ways to use Kubespray to deploy a Kubernetes cluster.

## requirements

- **Minimum required version of Kubernetes is v1.34.0**

- **Ansible v2.14+, Jinja 2.11+ and python-netaddr is installed on the machine that will run Ansible commands**
- The target servers must have **access to the Internet** in order to pull docker images. Otherwise, additional configuration is required (See [Offline Environment](docs/operations/offline-environment.md))
- The target servers are configured to allow **IPv4 forwarding**.
- If using IPv6 for pods and services, the target servers are configured to allow **IPv6 forwarding**.
- The **firewalls are not managed**, you'll need to implement your own rules the way you used to.
    in order to avoid any issue during deployment you should disable your firewall.
- If kubespray is run from non-root user account, correct privilege escalation method
    should be configured in the target servers. Then the `ansible_become` flag
    or command parameters `--become or -b` should be specified.

Hardware:
These limits are safeguarded by Kubespray. Actual requirements for your workload can differ. For a sizing guide go to the [Building Large Clusters](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/cluster-large/#size-of-master-and-master-components) guide.

# aerovato/container

Safely run OpenCode, Codex, Claude Code with full permissions.

## requirements

- Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Docker or Podman

## installation

macOS and Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://container.aerovato.com/install.sh | sh
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://container.aerovato.com/install.ps1 | iex
```

Alternatively, install through npm:

```bash
npm install -g @aerovato/container
```

## configuration

Run the guided onboarding flow:

```bash
container init
```

Choose your coding harnesses, development tools, runtime, and mounts, then accept the initial image build.

### Run

Navigate to a project and start its workspace:

```bash
cd /path/to/project
container
```

Your project is mounted at `/root/<project-name>`. The container and anything installed inside it persist between sessions.

Start your preferred coding agent and work normally:

```bash
opencode
npm install <package>
```

## Agent Skill

Want an agent to configure Container for you? Install the portable [Container skill](skills/container/SKILL.md) on the host, then ask your agent to set up packages, harnesses, tools, mounts, permissions, or migrations.

```bash
npx skills add aerovato/container --skill container
npx skills add aerovato/container --skill container --global  # All projects
```

The skill is host-side because agents inside managed containers cannot access Container's host configuration.

## tools

```bash
container                           # Open the current project's workspace
container run /path/to/project      # Open a specific project
container run /path -- -p 8080:80   # Pass runtime flags
container list                      # List managed containers
container stop                      # Stop the current workspace
container remove                    # Remove the current workspace
container settings                  # Change common settings
container init                      # Re-run onboarding
```

Rebuild the shared image when updating tools or customizations:

```bash
container build
container build tools
container build harness
container build user
```

## Customization

Add packages and setup commands to:

```text
~/.code-container/Dockerfile.User
```

Then rebuild the user layer:

```bash
container build user
```

Harnesses, tools, runtime flags, mounts, and base-image settings are configured through `~/.code-container/settings.json`.

See [Configuration](skills/container/references/configuration.md) for settings details and [Permissions](skills/container/references/permissions.md) for hands-off harness permissions.

## Security

`container` limits what an agent can access, but it does not make the agent trusted.

The current project is mounted read-write and can be changed or deleted. Enabled configurations and optional credentials may also be available inside the container. Containers retain network access, and `container` does not protect against prompt injection or agent misalignment.

Keep important work under version control and only mount resources the agent needs.

## Built with Operator

This repository is maintained with [Operator Memory](https://github.com/aerovato/operator-memory) — durable, agent-maintained documentation that lets AI agents work on the project with full context across sessions. The published brain lives in [`.operator-shared/`](.operator-shared/).

To work on Container with the same context, install Operator Memory:

```bash
# With NPM
npm install --global @aerovato/operator-helper

# With Bun
bun add --global --minimum-release-age 0 @aerovato/operator-helper@latest

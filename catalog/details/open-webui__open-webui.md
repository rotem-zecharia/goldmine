# open-webui/open-webui

User-friendly AI Interface (Supports Ollama, OpenAI API, ...)

## features

- 🚀 **Effortless Setup**: Install seamlessly via pip, uv, Docker, or Kubernetes (kubectl, kustomize, or helm), with `:ollama` and `:cuda` tagged images available for container deployments.

- 🤝 **Broad Model & API Integration**: Connect any OpenAI-compatible API alongside local Ollama models. Point the API URL at **LMStudio, GroqCloud, Mistral, OpenRouter, vLLM, and more** to mix and match providers freely.

- 🔐 **Granular RBAC & User Groups**: Administrators define detailed roles, groups, and permissions, giving each user exactly the access they need. Secure by default, with tailored experiences per group.

- 🧩 **Plugin Support**: Extend Open WebUI with **Filters**, **Actions**, **Pipes**, **Tools**, and **Skills**. Connect external services through **MCP**, **MCPO**, and **OpenAPI tool servers**. Build custom integrations, rate limits, approval flows, data connections, and more.

- 🤖 **Models & Agents**: Wrap any base model with custom instructions, tools, and knowledge to build specialized agents. Supports dynamic variables, per-user/group access control, and community preset imports via [Open WebUI Community](https://openwebui.com/).

- 📝 **Notes**: A dedicated workspace for content outside conversations. Draft with a rich editor, use AI to rewrite selected text, and attach notes to any chat for full-context injection.

- 📢 **Channels**: Real-time shared spaces where your team and AI models collaborate in one timeline. Tag models to draft or critique, with threads, reactions, pins, and access control.

- 🧠 **Persistent Memory**: The AI remembers facts about you across conversations, carrying context from one chat to the next.

- ✅ **Live Workflow & Message Flow**: Watch the AI build and work through checklists in real time. Queue messages while the AI is still responding; they send automatically when it's ready.

- 📅 **Calendar & AI Scheduling**: Built-in personal and shared calendars with month/week/day views, recurring events, color coding, attendees, and reminders. Models manage your schedule conversationally through native function calling.

- ⏱️ **Automations**: Schedule prompts to run on recurring schedules, with runs surfaced on your calendar and each completed run linking back to the chat it produced.

- 📱 **Responsive Design & PWA**: Seamless experience across desktop, laptop, and mobile, with a Progressive Web App for native app-like feel and offline access on localhost.

- ✒️🔢 **Full Markdown and LaTeX Support**: Comprehensive Markdown and LaTeX capabilities for enriched interaction.

- 🎤📹 **Hands-Free Voice/Video Call**: Integrated voice and video calls with multiple Speech-to-Text providers (Local Whisper, OpenAI, Deepgram, Azure) and Text-to-Speech engines (Azure, ElevenLabs, OpenAI, Transformers, WebAPI).

- 💾 **Persistent Artifact Storage**: Built-in key-value storage API for artifacts, enabling journals, trackers, leaderboards, and collaborative tools with personal and shared data scopes.

- 📚 **Local RAG Integration**: Retrieval Augmented Generation backed by 9 vector databases and multiple content-extraction engines (Tika, Docling, Document Intelligence, Mistral OCR, PaddleOCR-vl, external loaders). Supports hybrid search (BM25 + vector) with reranking and full-context mode. Load documents into chat or pull them from your library with the `#` command.

- 🔍 **Web Search for RAG**: Search the web through dozens of providers including `SearXNG`, `Google PSE`, `Brave Search`, `Kagi`, `Mojeek`, `Tavily`, `Perplexity`, `Firecrawl`, `serpstack`, `serper`, `Serply`, `DuckDuckGo`, `SearchApi`, `SerpApi`, `Bing`, `Jina`, `Exa`, `Sougou`, `Azure AI Search`, and `Ollama Cloud`, injecting results directly into the conversation.

- 🌐 **Web Browsing Capability**: Pull websites into chat with the `#` command followed by a URL, or let the model fetch them on its own when needed.

- 🎨 **Image Generation & Editing**: Create and edit images with multiple engines including OpenAI DALL·E, Gemini, ComfyUI (local), and AUTOMATI

## installation

### Installation via Python pip 🐍

Open WebUI can be installed using pip, the Python package installer. Before proceeding, ensure you're using **Python 3.11** to avoid compatibility issues.

1. **Install Open WebUI**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command to install Open WebUI:

   ```bash
   pip install open-webui
   ```

2. **Running Open WebUI**:
   After installation, you can start Open WebUI by executing:

   ```bash
   open-webui serve
   ```

This will start the Open WebUI server, which you can access at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

### Quick Start with Docker 🐳

> [!NOTE]  
> Please note that for certain Docker environments, additional configurations might be needed. If you encounter any connection issues, our detailed guide on [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/) is ready to assist you.

> [!WARNING]
> When using Docker to install Open WebUI, make sure to include the `-v open-webui:/app/backend/data` in your Docker command. This step is crucial as it ensures your database is properly mounted and prevents any loss of data.

> [!TIP]  
> If you wish to utilize Open WebUI with Ollama included or CUDA acceleration, we recommend utilizing our official images tagged with either `:cuda` or `:ollama`. To enable CUDA, you must install the [Nvidia CUDA container toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/nvidia-container-runtime-upgrade/) on your Linux/WSL system.

### Installation with Default Configuration

- **If Ollama is on your computer**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

- **If Ollama is on a Different Server**, use this command:

  To connect to Ollama on another server, change the `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` to the server's URL:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=https://example.com -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

- **To run Open WebUI with Nvidia GPU support**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --gpus all --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:cuda
  ```

### Installation for OpenAI API Usage Only

- **If you're only using OpenAI API**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_secret_key -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

### Installing Open WebUI with Bundled Ollama Support

This installation method uses a single container image that bundles Open WebUI with Ollama, allowing for a streamlined setup via a single command. Choose the appropriate command based on your hardware setup:

- **With GPU Support**:
  Utilize GPU resources by running the following command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --gpus=all -v ollama:/root/.ollama -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:ollama
  ```

- **For CPU Only**:
  If you're not using a GPU, use this command instead:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -v ollama:/root/.ollama -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:ollama
  ```

Both commands facilitate a built-in, hassle-free installation of both Open WebUI and Ollama, ensuring that you can get everything up and running swiftly.

After installation, you can access Open WebUI at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Enjoy! 😄

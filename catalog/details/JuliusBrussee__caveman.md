# JuliusBrussee/caveman

🪨 why use many token when few token do trick. Viral skill + proxy for coding agents that cuts 65% of tokens by talking like a caveman.

## features

**Caveman make your AI agent say less and read less. Code stay exact. Brain still big.**

> The reason your React component is re-rendering is likely because you're creating a new object reference on each render cycle. When you pass an inline object as a prop, React's shallow comparison sees it as a different object every time, which triggers a re-render. I'd recommend using useMemo to memoize the object.

**Same fix. 63 token become 20. Brain still big.**

Pick your club:

| Skill | Same answer | Tokens |
|---|---|---:|
| `/caveman` | New object ref each render, so React re-renders. Wrap the prop in `useMemo`. | 20 |
| `/ultracave` | Inline object prop, new ref, re-render. `useMemo`. | 14 |
| `/megacave` | 新參照致重繪。`useMemo`。 | **13** |

## How caveman talks

Caveman is a voice, not broken grammar. Every reply follows the same structure:

| Rule | What it means |
|---|---|
| **Answer first** | `[thing] [action] [reason]. [next step].` No greeting, no "let me", no recap, no "hope this helps" |
| **One idea per sentence** | Built on [ASD-STE100](https://www.asd-ste100.org/), the controlled English written for aircraft maintenance manuals: 20 words max, active voice, one term per thing |
| **Meaning never dropped** | Articles can go. *not*, *never*, *no*, *only* never go. Numbers and units stay exact |
| **Payload verbatim** | Code, commands, paths, and error messages untouched, character for character |
| **Quiet tool runs** | No chatter between tool calls. One line per phase, one line with the result |
| **Knows when to stop** | Security warnings, irreversible actions, step-by-step orders, and confused users get full sentences. Then grunt resumes |
| 

## installation

```bash
npx skills add JuliusBrussee/caveman -g
```

Works in Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Copilot, and [30+ more](./INSTALL.md). Type `/caveman` if it doesn't start on its own. Say `stop caveman` to go back. One rock. That it.

<summary><strong>Other ways in</strong>: Claude Code plugin, Gemini, every agent at once, Windows, uninstall</summary>

```bash
# Claude Code plugin, auto-starts every session
claude plugin marketplace add JuliusBrussee/caveman && claude plugin install caveman@caveman

# Gemini CLI
gemini extensions install https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman

# Every agent on your machine at once, plus the Claude Code statusline badge (Node.js 22.13+)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman/v3.1.0/install.sh | bash
```

Windows, PowerShell 5.1+:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman/v3.1.0/install.ps1 | iex
```

Changed your mind: `npx -y github:JuliusBrussee/caveman -- --uninstall`

Install broke? Open your agent in this repo and say *"Read CLAUDE.md and INSTALL.md, install caveman for me."* Agent fix own brain.

## The numbers

Outside labs first, then ours. Nothing rounded up. Red rows stay red.

| Who | Setup | Result |
|---|---|---|
| **[Adobe Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.24083)**, CAVEWOMAN paper (cites this repo) | Caveman-style output, eight models, five datasets | **Cost cut 1.4 to 2.4× per model, up to 3×** |
| **[Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/elastic-caveman-ai-token-reduction)**, Elasticsearch Labs | Caveman mode remade for Elasticsearch, eight live MCP scenarios | **63.6% fewer response tokens.** *"Zero information loss."* |
| **[JetBrains](https://blog.jetbrains.com/ai/2026/07/speak-to-ai-agents-like-cavemen-tosave-tokens/)** | 86 real coding tasks, paired A/B | **No measurable quality loss** (p = 0.82). 8.5% fewer output tokens |

Two findings shaped caveman. Adobe found that cavemanning *your* prompt makes answers longer and worse, so caveman never touches your prompt. JetBrains found that agent sessions are mostly code and tool calls, which the skill leaves alone. So caveman grew a second rock that shrinks what the agent *reads*: [the proxy](#big-rock-the-proxy).

### The proxy: 33.2% fewer input tokens

| File type | The file, through caveman | File saved | Whole Claude Code session, 3 runs | Session saved |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| CSV | 28,041 → **314** | **98.9%** | 165,823 → 74,484 | **55.1%** |
| Logs | 22,810 → **348** | **98.5%** | 148,807 → 74,068 | **50.2%** |
| YAML | 20,447 → **178** | **99.1%** | 132,124 → 71,027 | **46.2%** |
| Test output | 18,806 → **203** | **98.9%** | 150,377 → 108,514 | **27.8%** |
| JSON | 18,837 → **281** | **98.5%** | 147,975 → 108,939 | **26.4%** |
| HTML | 21,670 → 21,670 | none yet | 140,687 → 154,641 | 9.9% worse |
| **All six** | 130,611 → 22,994 | 82.4% | **885,793 → 591,673** | **33.2%** |

**18 of 18 answers right.** *The file* is each benchmark file run through today's compressor on its own. *The session* is the whole agent run, which also carries the system prompt, tool definitions, conversation, and caveman's own rules, so it moves less than the file. The session run is from August 2026, on an engine that only got the JSON file down to 8,106 tokens. HTML has no compressor yet, so caveman paid its overhead and won nothing back. Each file hides one record in 61 to 72 KB of noise; your files will vary. Headroom on the same suite got 15 of 18 right and used 6.7% fewer tokens on those 15. [Method](./docs/WRAP-BENCHMARK.md#per-file-compression)

### The skill: ten dev questions on claude-opus-5-5

| Instruction | Output tokens |
|---|---:|
| None | 6,983 |
| `Answer concisely.` | 4,334 |
| `/caveman` | 4,119 |
| `/ultracave` | **2,693** |

New models already know "be concise", so that line is the real baseline. On top of it, `/caveman` cuts 3% more at the median and `/ultracave` cuts 35% more. [Harness](./

# PrefectHQ/prefect

Prefect is a workflow orchestration framework for building resilient data pipelines in Python.

## installation

Prefect requires Python 3.10+. To [install the latest version of Prefect](https://docs.prefect.io/v3/get-started/install), run one of the following commands:

```bash
pip install -U prefect
```

```bash
uv add prefect
```

Then create and run a Python file that uses Prefect `flow` and `task` decorators to orchestrate and observe your workflow - in this case, a simple script that fetches the number of GitHub stars from a repository:

```python
from prefect import flow, task
import httpx


@task(log_prints=True)
def get_stars(repo: str):
    url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{repo}"
    count = httpx.get(url).json()["stargazers_count"]
    print(f"{repo} has {count} stars!")


@flow(name="GitHub Stars")
def github_stars(repos: list[str]):
    for repo in repos:
        get_stars(repo)

Build resilient agents.

## features

LangGraph provides low-level supporting infrastructure for *any* long-running, stateful workflow or agent:

- **[Durable execution](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/durable-execution)** — Build agents that persist through failures and can run for extended periods, automatically resuming from exactly where they left off.
- **[Human-in-the-loop](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/interrupts)** — Seamlessly incorporate human oversight by inspecting and modifying agent state at any point during execution.
- **[Comprehensive memory](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/memory)** — Create truly stateful agents with both short-term working memory for ongoing reasoning and long-term persistent memory across sessions.
- **[Debugging with LangSmith](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith)** — Gain deep visibility into complex agent behavior with visualization tools that trace execution paths, capture state transitions, and provide detailed runtime metrics.
- **[Production-ready deployment](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/deployments)** — Deploy sophisticated agent systems confidently with scalable infrastructure designed to handle the unique challenges of stateful, long-running workflows.

> [!TIP]
> For developing, debugging, and deploying AI agents and LLM applications, see [LangSmith](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/home).

## LangGraph ecosystem

While LangGraph can be used standalone, it also integrates seamlessly with any LangChain product, giving developers a full suite of tools for building agents.

To improve your LLM application development, pair LangGraph with:

- [Deep Agents](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/deepagents/overview) – Build agents that can plan, use subagents, and leverage file systems for complex tasks.
- [LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/overview) – Provides integrations and composable components to streamline LLM application development.
- [LangSmith](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith) – Helpful for agent evals and observability. Debug poor-performing LLM app runs, evaluate agent trajectories, gain visibility in production, and improve performance over time.
- [LangSmith Deployment](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/deployments) – Deploy and scale agents effortlessly with a purpose-built deployment platform for long-running, stateful workflows. Discover, reuse, configure, and share agents across teams – and iterate quickly with visual prototyping in [LangSmith Studio](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/studio).

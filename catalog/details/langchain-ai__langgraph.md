Build resilient agents.

## features

LangGraph provides low-level supporting infrastructure for *any* long-running, stateful workflow or agent:

- **[Durable execution](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/durable-execution)** — Build agents that persist through failures and can run for extended periods, automatically resuming from exactly where they left off.
- **[Human-in-the-loop](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/interrupts)** — Seamlessly incorporate human oversight by inspecting and modifying agent state at any point during execution.
- **[Comprehensive memory](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/memory)** — Create truly stateful agents with both short-term working memory for ongoing reasoning and long-term persistent memory across sessions.
- **[Debugging with LangSmith](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith)** — Gain deep visibility into complex agent behavior with visualization tools that trace execution paths, capture state transitions, and provide detailed runtime metrics.
- **[Production-ready deployment](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/deployments)** — Deploy sophisticated agent systems confidently with scalable infrastructure designed to handle the unique challenges of stateful, long-running workflows.

# coleam00/Archon

The first open-source harness builder for AI coding. Make AI coding deterministic and repeatable.

## features

When you ask an AI agent to "fix this bug", what happens depends on the model's mood. It might skip planning. It might forget to run tests. It might write a PR description that ignores your template. Every run is different.

Archon fixes this. Encode your development process as a workflow. The workflow defines the phases, validation gates, and artifacts. The AI fills in the intelligence at each step, but the structure is deterministic and owned by you.

- **Repeatable** - Same workflow, same sequence, every time. Plan, implement, validate, review, PR.
- **Isolated** - Every workflow run gets its own git worktree. Run 5 fixes in parallel with no conflicts.
- **Fire and forget** - Kick off a workflow, go do other work. Come back to a finished PR with review comments.
- **Composable** - Mix deterministic nodes (bash scripts, tests, git ops) with AI nodes (planning, code generation, review). The AI only runs where it adds value.
- **Portable** - Define workflows once in `.archon/workflows/`, commit them to your repo. They work the same from CLI, Web UI, Slack, Telegram, or GitHub.

## installation

> **Most users should start with the [Full Setup](#full-setup-5-minutes)** - it walks you through credentials, installs the Archon skill into your projects, and gives you the web dashboard.
>
> **Already have Claude Code and just want the CLI?** Jump to the [Quick Install](#quick-install-30-seconds).

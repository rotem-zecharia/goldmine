# bytedance/deer-flow

An open-source long-horizon SuperAgent harness that researches, codes, and creates. With the help of sandboxes, memories, tools, skill, subagents and message gateway, it handles different levels of ta

## installation

If you use Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, or another coding agent, you can hand it the setup instructions in one sentence:

```text
Help me clone DeerFlow if needed, then bootstrap it for local development by following https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bytedance/deer-flow/main/Install.md
```

That prompt is intended for coding agents. It tells the agent to clone the repo if needed, choose Docker when available, and stop with the exact next command plus any missing config the user still needs to provide.

## Quick Start

## configuration

1. **Clone the DeerFlow repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow.git
   cd deer-flow
   ```

2. **Run the setup wizard**

   From the project root directory (`deer-flow/`), run:

   ```bash
   make setup
   ```

   This launches an interactive wizard that guides you through choosing an LLM provider, optional web search, and execution/safety preferences such as sandbox mode, bash access, and file-write tools. It generates a minimal `config.yaml` and writes your keys to `.env`. Takes about 2 minutes.

   The wizard also lets you configure an optional web search provider, or skip it for now.

   Run `make doctor` at any time to verify your setup and get actionable fix hints.
   If you are opening a GitHub issue about a local setup or runtime problem, run
   `make support-bundle`. The command prints reporter next steps, writes a
   `*-issue-summary.md` file to paste into the issue, a `*-issue-draft.md` file
   for AI-assisted issue filing, and an optional evidence zip under
   `.deer-flow/support-bundles/`. If an AI assistant files the issue, start from
   the draft and replace every REQUIRED placeholder instead of inventing missing
   facts. Attach the zip only if a maintainer asks for it, or if the summary
   alone is not enough. Maintainers and AI triage tools can start with
   `triage.json`; the bundle includes redacted diagnostics and file manifests
   only, and does not include `.env`, raw conversation messages, or user file
   contents.

   > **Advanced / manual configuration**: If you prefer to edit `config.yaml` directly, run `make config` instead to copy the full template. See `config.example.yaml` for the complete reference including CLI-backed providers (Codex CLI, Claude Code OAuth), OpenRouter, Responses API, subagent runtime caps such as `subagents.max_total_per_run`, and more.

   Optional per-model pricing must use one currency across all priced models.
   DeerFlow disables Console cost estimates when currencies are mixed rather
   than presenting an invalid aggregate.

       use: langchain_openai:ChatOpenAI
       model: gpt-4o
       api_key: $OPENAI_API_KEY

       use_responses_api: true

     - name: qwen3-32b-vllm
       display_name: Qwen3 32B (vLLM)
       use: deerflow.models.vllm_provider:VllmChatModel
       model: Qwen/Qwen3-32B

         extra_body:
           chat_template_kwargs:
             enable_thinking: true
   ```

   OpenRouter and similar OpenAI-compatible gateways should be configured with `langchain_openai:ChatOpenAI` plus `base_url`. If you prefer a provider-specific environment variable name, point `api_key` at that variable explicitly (for example `api_key: $OPENROUTER_API_KEY`).

   To route OpenAI models through `/v1/responses`, keep using `langchain_openai:ChatOpenAI` and set `use_responses_api: true` with `output_version: responses/v1`.

   For vLLM 0.19.0, use `deerflow.models.vllm_provider:VllmChatModel`. For Qwen-style reasoning models, DeerFlow toggles reasoning with `extra_body.chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking` and preserves vLLM's non-standard `reasoning` field across multi-turn tool-call conversations. Legacy `thinking` configs are normalized automatically for backward compatibility. If the endpoint reports a cumu

## tools

Skills are what make DeerFlow do *almost anything*.

A standard Agent Skill is a structured capability module — a Markdown file that defines a workflow, best practices, and references to supporting resources. DeerFlow ships with built-in skills for research, report generation, slide creation, web pages, image and video generation, and more. But the real power is extensibility: add your own skills, replace the built-in ones, or combine them into compound workflows.

Skills are loaded progressively — only when the task needs them, not all at once. This keeps the context window lean and makes DeerFlow work well even with token-sensitive models.

A skill directory is a package boundary: once DeerFlow finds its `SKILL.md`, nested `SKILL.md` files under that package (for example evaluation fixtures) remain supporting data and are not registered as runtime skills. Namespace directories without their own `SKILL.md` can still group nested skills.

Users can explicitly activate an enabled skill for a single turn by starting the request with `/skill-name`, for example `/data-analysis analyze uploads/foo.csv`. DeerFlow loads that skill's `SKILL.md` as hidden current-turn context while leaving the base prompt limited to skill metadata. Slash activation respects disabled skills, custom-agent skill whitelists, and existing channel commands such as `/new` and `/help`.

An enabled skill's `allowed-tools` policy applies only after that skill is explicitly slash-activated or captured in the agent's active skill context after a `read_file` load. Merely enabling, advertising, or listing a skill in a custom agent or subagent `skills` allowlist does not reduce that agent's normal toolset; subagents use the same progressive discovery and activation policy as the lead agent. During a slash-activated run, that explicit skill's policy is authoritative: reading another `SKILL.md` may provide instructions but cannot widen the slash skill's tools. Without slash activation, policies from skills actually loaded into active context retain their union semantics. Once active, the policy filters both model-visible tool schemas and tool execution. Framework discovery tools (`tool_search` and `describe_skill`) remain available so an allowed deferred tool or installed skill can still be discovered, but discovery and promotion never grant permission to execute a business tool omitted from `allowed-tools`. `task` is not framework-exempt; a restrictive skill must list it explicitly to delegate to a subagent. Per-step policy decisions are internal runtime context and are removed from observable or persisted context copies. Registry failures and an active set with no remaining valid skill fail closed to framework-safe tools; individual stale paths are ignored only when another valid active skill remains. This is best-effort behavioral scoping, not a hard security boundary: loading skill instructions through another tool is not captured, and active-skill entries can be evicted from bounded context.

When you install `.skill` archives through the Gateway, DeerFlow accepts standard optional frontmatter metadata such as `version`, `author`, and `compatibility` instead of rejecting otherwise valid external skills.

Disabling a skill also removes it from the sandbox filesystem view, so shell commands and structured file tools follow the same enabled state. Local, Docker/AIO, hostPath provisioner, and newly created E2B sandboxes source `/mnt/skills` from enabled-only projections that update when public, custom, legacy, or managed integration skills are toggled, edited, created, deleted, or installed. Structured `read_file` calls (including line ranges and read-before-write checks) use the sandbox provider's mount mapping, so the user identity captured when the sandbox was acquired remains authoritative. Managed integration packages remain shared, while their projected filesystem visibility follows each user's enabled state. Multi-worker Gateways re-read on-disk enable state wh

# AgriciDaniel/claude-seo

Universal SEO skill for Claude Code. 25 sub-skills + 18 sub-agents covering technical SEO, E-E-A-T, schema, GEO/AEO, backlinks, local SEO, maps intelligence, semantic clustering, e-commerce SEO, inter

## features

- **AI-search first.** Aligned with [Google's AI Optimization Guide](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/ai-optimization-guide). Question-based citability scoring, primary-source evidence on llms.txt, IPTC `TrainedAlgorithmicMedia` for AI-generated product images, agent-friendly page checks per [web.dev](https://web.dev/).
- **Parallel execution.** Full site audits spawn up to 15 specialist agents simultaneously. Site-level audits complete in minutes rather than hours.
- **Falsifiable, not promotional.** Every recommendation carries the first-principle observation it rests on, its dependency relationships, an explicit "how would we know this failed?" check, and a leading indicator. See [Methodology](#methodology).

### Real results

Google Search Console for a site started 23 March 2026 and run on this workflow: total clicks and impressions across its first three months, through 12 June 2026.

> Using Codex instead of Claude Code? Use [Codex SEO](https://github.com/AgriciDaniel/codex-seo), the Codex-first port with TOML agents, plugin packaging, deterministic runners, and the same SEO workflow surface.

## Who this is for

- **SEO agencies running 5+ client sites.** Replace quarterly deep audits with weekly automated runs. Same team capacity, 4× audit cadence, every recommendation comes with a falsifiability check the client can verify.
- **In-house SEO leads at SaaS / publisher / e-commerce companies.** Second-pair-of-eyes before executive reviews. Catches what GSC and Lighthouse hide: schema deprecation, AI-citability gaps, expired-domain heritage risk, parasite-SEO exposure, machine-translation drift.
- **Freelance SEO consultants.** Anchor day-one client scope with a 15-minute audit and a real 0-100 score. Win the engagement with concrete proof of value before you spend an hour writing the proposal.

## installation

> ℹ️ **Which version are you installing?**
>
> - **Public open-source (default).** The commands below install from [`AgriciDaniel/claude-seo`](https://github.com/AgriciDaniel/claude-seo) — MIT, public releases, no membership required.
> - **AI Marketing Hub Pro member?** Install the community version with early access instead: swap `AgriciDaniel/claude-seo` for `AI-Marketing-Hub/claude-seo` and the plugin slug `claude-seo@agricidaniel-claude-seo` for `claude-seo@ai-marketing-hub-claude-seo`. Requires `gh auth login` (or PAT) with access to the `AI-Marketing-Hub` org. If `/plugin marketplace add` 404s, DM in the [Skool community](https://www.skool.com/ai-marketing-hub-pro) to get added.

### Plugin Install (Claude Code 1.0.33+)

The fastest path. One-time marketplace add, then plugin install:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add AgriciDaniel/claude-seo
/plugin install claude-seo@agricidaniel-claude-seo
/seo setup
```

The explicit setup step creates an isolated Python environment in Claude's
persistent plugin data and installs Playwright Chromium. Check it at any time
with `/seo doctor`. No global Python packages or PATH shims are created.

### Manual Install (Unix / macOS / Linux)

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/AgriciDaniel/claude-seo.git
bash claude-seo/install.sh
```

<details>
<summary>One-liner (curl, review then run)</summary>

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AgriciDaniel/claude-seo/main/install.sh > install.sh
cat install.sh        # review before running
bash install.sh
rm install.sh
```

</details>

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/AgriciDaniel/claude-seo.git
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File claude-seo\install.ps1
```

> **Why `git clone` instead of `irm | iex`?** Claude Code's own security guardrails flag `irm ... | iex` as a supply chain risk: downloading and executing remote code without verification. The `git clone` approach lets you inspect `claude-seo\install.ps1` before running it.

## limitations

Two real boundaries worth being upfront about.

**Heavy client-side hydration timing.** Phase A's headless renderer handles most SPAs out of the box (`--render auto` detects empty `<div id="root">` shells and switches to Playwright). Edge cases that still produce noisy findings: pages with hydration tied to scroll position past the fold, pages that fetch critical content after user interaction (modal opens, tab clicks), pages with race-condition-prone third-party widget mounts. For these, manually triggering the `seo-visual` subagent and comparing its Playwright snapshot to the raw-HTML subagents' findings is the recommended workflow.

**Local-only without enrichment.** The free tier makes no third-party API calls by default (audits still fetch the target URLs you point them at). Adding Google API credentials (Tier 0 through 3) unlocks real field data and live indexation status; without them, Core Web Vitals are lab estimates only and indexation is inferred from page-level signals. Adding MCP extensions (Ahrefs, DataForSEO, SE Ranking, Profound) similarly unlocks competitive and AI-citation data but requires their respective accounts.

## requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Claude Code CLI
- Optional: Playwright Chromium — install.sh offers to install it (you can skip the prompt); needed only for SPA rendering and screenshots
- Optional: Google API credentials for enriched CWV / GSC / GA4 data (see `/seo google setup`)

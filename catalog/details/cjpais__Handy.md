# cjpais/Handy

A free, open source, and extensible speech-to-text application that works completely offline.

## features

Handy was created to fill the gap for a truly open source, extensible speech-to-text tool. As stated on [handy.computer](https://handy.computer):

- **Free**: Accessibility tooling belongs in everyone's hands, not behind a paywall
- **Open Source**: Together we can build further. Extend Handy for yourself and contribute to something bigger
- **Private**: Your voice stays on your computer. Get transcriptions without sending audio to the cloud
- **Simple**: One tool, one job. Transcribe what you say and put it into a text box

Handy isn't trying to be the best speech-to-text app—it's trying to be the most forkable one.

## How It Works

1. **Press** a configurable keyboard shortcut: hold it to record and release to stop, or tap it to toggle recording on and off (Hold-only and Toggle-only modes are also available)
2. **Speak** your words while the shortcut is active
3. **Release** and Handy processes your speech using Whisper
4. **Get** your transcribed text pasted directly into whatever app you're using

The process is entirely local:

- Silence is filtered using VAD (Voice Activity Detection) with Silero
- Transcription uses your choice of models:
  - **Whisper models** (Small/Medium/Turbo/Large) with GPU acceleration when available
  - **Parakeet V3** - CPU-optimized model with excellent performance and automatic language detection
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Architecture

Handy is built as a Tauri application combining:

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript with Tailwind CSS for the settings UI
- **Backend**: Rust for system integration, audio processing, and ML inference
- **Core Libraries**:
  - `transcribe-cpp`: Local speech recognition with Whisper-family models (GGML/GGUF)
  - `transcribe-rs`: CPU-optimized speech recognition with Parakeet models
  - `cpal`: Cross-platform audio I/O
  - `vad-rs`: Voice Activity Detection
  - `rdev`: Global keyboard shortcuts and system events
  - `rubato`: Audio resampling

### Debug Mode

Handy includes an advanced debug mode for development and troubleshooting. Access it by pressing:

- **macOS**: `Cmd+Shift+D`
- **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl+Shift+D`

### CLI Parameters

Handy supports command-line flags for controlling a running instance and customizing startup behavior. These work on all platforms (macOS, Windows, Linux).

**Remote control flags** (sent to an already-running instance via the single-instance plugin):

```bash
handy --toggle-transcription    # Toggle recording on/off
handy --toggle-post-process     # Toggle recording with post-processing on/off
handy --cancel                  # Cancel the current operation
```

**Startup flags:**

```bash
handy --start-hidden            # Start without showing the main window
handy --no-tray                 # Start without the system tray icon
handy --debug                   # Enable debug mode with verbose logging
handy --help                    # Show all available flags
```

Flags can be combined for autostart scenarios:

```bash
handy --start-hidden --no-tray
```

> **macOS tip:** When Handy is installed as an app bundle, invoke the binary directly:
>
> ```bash
> /Applications/Handy.app/Contents/MacOS/Handy --toggle-transcription
> ```

## limitations

This project is actively being developed and has some [known issues](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues). We believe in transparency about the current state:

### Bluetooth Headset Microphones (macOS)

Using a Bluetooth headset microphone on macOS may temporarily reduce playback quality or volume while recording because Bluetooth switches to bidirectional audio. Keep your headphones as the output device and select your Mac's built-in or an external microphone in Handy to avoid this.

### fn and Globe Key Shortcuts (macOS)

Shortcuts that include the `fn` (Globe) key **only work on Apple keyboards** — your Mac's built-in keyboard or an Apple external keyboard. They will never trigger on a third-party keyboard, even while it is connected to the same Mac.

This is a hardware limitation rather than a Handy bug. `fn` is not part of the standard USB HID keyboard specification: Apple reports it through a vendor-specific usage that macOS honors only from Apple devices, while third-party keyboards handle their `Fn` key entirely in firmware and send nothing to the computer. There is no event for Handy to listen for.

If you switch between a MacBook keyboard and an external one, pick a shortcut built from standard modifiers (`ctrl`, `option`, `shift`, `command`) or a regular key instead.

### Major Issues (Help Wanted)

**Whisper Model Crashes:**

- Whisper models crash on certain system configurations (Windows and Linux)
- Does not affect all systems - issue is configuration-dependent
  - If you experience crashes and are a developer, please help to fix and provide debug logs!

**Wayland Support (Linux):**

- Limited support for Wayland display server
- Requires [`wtype`](https://github.com/atx/wtype) or [`dotool`](https://sr.ht/~geb/dotool/) for text input to work correctly (see [Linux Notes](#linux-notes) below for installation)

### Linux Notes

**Text Input Tools:**

For reliable text input on Linux, install the appropriate tool for your display server:

| Display Server | Recommended Tool | Install Command                                    |
| -------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| X11            | `xdotool`        | `sudo apt install xdotool`                         |
| Wayland        | `wtype`          | `sudo apt install wtype`                           |
| Both           | `dotool`         | `sudo apt install dotool` (requires `input` group) |

- **X11**: Install `xdotool` for both direct typing and clipboard paste shortcuts
- **Ubuntu 26.04**: Has Wayland display server by default. `wtype` does not work, you need to install `ydotool` and configure systemd as described [here](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/pull/557#issuecomment-3781249267).
- **Wayland**: Install `wtype` (preferred) or `dotool` for text input to work correctly
- **dotool setup**: Requires adding your user to the `input` group: `sudo usermod -aG input $USER` (then log out and back in)

Without these tools, Handy falls back to enigo which may have limited compatibility, especially on Wayland.

**Other Notes:**

- **Runtime library dependency (`libgtk-layer-shell.so.0`)**:
  - Handy links `gtk-layer-shell` on Linux. If startup fails with `error while loading shared libraries: libgtk-layer-shell.so.0`, install the runtime package for your distro:

    | Distro        | Package to install    | Example command                        |
    | ------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
    | Ubuntu/Debian | `libgtk-layer-shell0` | `sudo apt install libgtk-layer-shell0` |
    | Fedora/RHEL   | `gtk-layer-shell`     | `sudo dnf install gtk-layer-shell`     |
    | Arch Linux    | `gtk-layer-shell`     | `sudo pacman -S gtk-layer-shell`       |

  - For building from source on Ubuntu/Debian, you may also need `libgtk-layer-shell-dev`.

- The recording overlay is disabled by default on Linux (`Overlay Position: None`) because certain compositors treat it as the active window. Whe

## requirements

The following are recommendations for running Handy on your own machine. If you don't meet the system requirements, the performance of the application may be degraded. We are working on improving the performance across all kinds of computers and hardware.

**For Whisper Models:**

- **macOS**: M series Mac, Intel Mac
- **Windows**: Intel, AMD, or NVIDIA GPU
- **Linux**: Intel, AMD, or NVIDIA GPU
  - Ubuntu 22.04, 24.04

**For Parakeet V3 Model:**

- **CPU-only operation** - runs on a wide variety of hardware
- **Minimum**: Intel Skylake (6th gen) or equivalent AMD processors
- **Performance**: ~5x real-time speed on mid-range hardware (tested on i5)
- **Automatic language detection** - no manual language selection required

## tools

On Windows, Handy asks the Vulkan loader to skip implicit layers to avoid crashes caused by overlay and capture hooks ([#2049](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/2049)). GPU acceleration remains enabled; this does not change system-wide settings.

To opt out for GPU selection or debugging tools, fully quit Handy (including the tray icon), then run both commands in the same PowerShell window:

```powershell
$env:HANDY_KEEP_VULKAN_IMPLICIT_LAYERS = "1"
& "$env:ProgramFiles\Handy\handy.exe"
```

Adjust the executable path if needed. This override only applies to apps launched from that PowerShell session, not the Start menu. Handy also preserves any existing `VK_LOADER_LAYERS_DISABLE` value.

### Handy Starts or Stops Recording on Its Own (Linux)

Handy 0.9.4 and earlier listened for `SIGUSR1` as a remote-control trigger. WebKitGTK — the webview engine embedded in Handy on Linux — uses that same signal internally to coordinate JavaScript garbage collection, so GC cycles were misread as hotkey presses: recordings started on their own, or real dictations were cut off mid-sentence (typically ~2 minutes in). See [#1660](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/1660).

Update to a newer release, and replace any `pkill -USR1 -n handy` keybindings with `handy --toggle-post-process`.

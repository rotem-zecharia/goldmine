Tesseract Open Source OCR Engine (main repository)

## installation

You can either [Install Tesseract via pre-built binary package](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html)
or [build it from source](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Compiling.html).

Before building Tesseract from source, please check that your system has a compiler which is one of the [supported compilers](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/supported-compilers.html).

## Running Tesseract

Basic **[command line usage](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Command-Line-Usage.html)**:

    tesseract imagename outputbase [-l lang] [--oem ocrenginemode] [--psm pagesegmode] [configfiles...]

For more information about the various command line options use `tesseract --help` or `man tesseract`.

Examples can be found in the [documentation](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Command-Line-Usage.html#simplest-invocation-to-ocr-an-image).

## For developers

Developers can use `libtesseract` [C](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/main/include/tesseract/capi.h) or
[C++](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/main/include/tesseract/baseapi.h) API to build their own application. If you need bindings to `libtesseract` for other programming languages, please see the
[wrapper](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/AddOns.html#tesseract-wrappers) section in the AddOns documentation.

Documentation of Tesseract generated from source code by doxygen can be found on [tesseract-ocr.github.io](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/).

Tesseract uses the [Leptonica library](http://www.leptonica.org/) which essentially
uses a [BSD 2-clause license](http://www.leptonica.org/about-the-license.html).

## requirements

Tesseract uses [Leptonica library](https://github.com/DanBloomberg/leptonica)
for opening input images (e.g. not documents like pdf).
It is suggested to use leptonica with built-in support for [zlib](https://zlib.net),
[png](https://sourceforge.net/projects/libpng) and
[tiff](http://www.simplesystems.org/libtiff) (for multipage tiff).

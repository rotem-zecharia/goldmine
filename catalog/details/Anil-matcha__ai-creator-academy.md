# Anil-matcha/ai-creator-academy

Free, open-source curriculum for making money with generative AI image, video, and audio — for creators and agencies.

## features

Paid communities teaching this (Skool/Whop-style, $47–$97/mo) already cluster around exactly these niches — the demand is proven. What's missing is a version that's free, that cites real numbers instead of vague income claims, and that treats "how do I actually get paid for this" as the main subject instead of an afterthought bolted onto a tool tutorial.

## requirements

- No coding required.
- Either an API key for a generative media provider (any provider works — [muapi.ai](https://muapi.ai) is used as the reference throughout, since it aggregates 500+ models under one API), or a local/self-hosted setup (e.g. ComfyUI) for the modules that support it — every module's "Compare Tools" section covers both paths.
- Curiosity about running this as an actual service, not just a hobby.

## FAQ

**Do I need to know how to code?**
No. Every module is written for creators and freelancers — the only technical step in most modules is calling a generation API or using a tool's UI. If you want to go further, [Track 15](tracks/15-ai-agents-and-vibe-coding/) covers using coding agents to build your own tools — no prior programming background required there either.

**Do I have to use muapi.ai?**
No — any generative media provider works. muapi.ai is used as the reference implementation throughout because it aggregates many models behind one API, but the underlying technique in each module isn't provider-specific.

**Is there a local/free-to-run option, or do I need to pay for API credits?**
Both are covered. Every module's "Compare Tools" section shows the API path alongside a local/self-hosted path (e.g. ComfyUI) where one realistically exists, with an honest cost/speed/quality tradeoff.

**Why isn't [track/niche] covered yet?**
Only Track 1 is fully written so far — it's the pilot proving the format before the rest get written. See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for what's planned, and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you want to help write one.

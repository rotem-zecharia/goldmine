# langchain-ai/langchain

The agent engineering platform.

## installation

```bash
uv add langchain
```

```python
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

model = init_chat_model("openai:gpt-5.5")
result = model.invoke("Hello, world!")
```

If you're looking for more advanced customization or agent orchestration, check out [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph), our framework for building controllable agent workflows.

For an equivalent JS/TS library, check out [LangChain.js](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs).

## features

LangChain helps developers build applications powered by LLMs through a standard interface for models, embeddings, vector stores, and more.

- **Real-time data augmentation** — Easily connect LLMs to diverse data sources and external/internal systems, drawing from LangChain's vast library of integrations with model providers, tools, vector stores, retrievers, and more
- **Model interoperability** — Swap models in and out as your engineering team experiments to find the best choice for your application's needs. As the industry frontier evolves, adapt quickly — LangChain's abstractions keep you moving without losing momentum
- **Rapid prototyping** — Quickly build and iterate on LLM applications with LangChain's modular, component-based architecture. Test different approaches and workflows without rebuilding from scratch, accelerating your development cycle
- **Production-ready features** — Deploy reliable applications with built-in support for monitoring, evaluation, and debugging through integrations like LangSmith. Scale with confidence using battle-tested patterns and best practices
- **Vibrant community and ecosystem** — Leverage a rich ecosystem of integrations, templates, and community-contributed components. Benefit from continuous improvements and stay up-to-date with the latest AI developments through an active open-source community
- **Flexible abstraction layers** — Work at the level of abstraction that suits your needs — from high-level chains for quick starts to low-level components for fine-grained control. LangChain grows with your application's complexity

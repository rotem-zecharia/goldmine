Application Kernel for Containers

## features

Containers are not a [**sandbox**][sandbox]. While containers have
revolutionized how we develop, package, and deploy applications, using them to
run untrusted or potentially malicious code without additional isolation is not
a good idea. While using a single, shared kernel allows for efficiency and
performance gains, it also means that container escape is possible with a single
vulnerability.

gVisor is an application kernel for containers. It limits the host kernel
surface accessible to the application while still giving the application access
to all the features it expects. Unlike most kernels, gVisor does not assume or
require a fixed set of physical resources; instead, it leverages existing host
kernel functionality and runs as a normal process. In other words, gVisor
implements Linux by way of Linux.

gVisor should not be confused with technologies and tools to harden containers
against external threats, provide additional integrity checks, or limit the
scope of access for a service. One should always be careful about what data is
made available to a container.

## installation

gVisor builds on x86_64 and ARM64. Other architectures may become available in
the future.

For the purposes of these instructions, [bazel][bazel] and other build
dependencies are wrapped in a build container. It is possible to use
[bazel][bazel] directly, or type `make help` for standard targets.

## requirements

Make sure the following dependencies are installed:

*   Linux 5.6+
*   [Docker version 17.09.0 or greater][docker]

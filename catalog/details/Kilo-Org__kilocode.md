<details>
<summary>Install the CLI from GitHub Releases (binaries)</summary>

Download the latest binary from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/releases).

| Platform | Asset |
|---|---|
| Windows (most PCs) | `kilo-windows-x64.zip` |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `kilo-darwin-arm64.zip` |
| macOS (Intel) | `kilo-darwin-x64.zip` |
| Linux x64 | `kilo-linux-x64.tar.gz` |
| Linux ARM | `kilo-linux-arm64.tar.gz` |

Notes: `x64-baseline` is a compatibility build for older CPUs without AVX. `musl` is the statically linked build for Alpine or minimal Docker images without glibc. `kilo-vscode-*.vsix` is the VS Code extension package, not the CLI. `Source code` archives are for building from source.

### Agents

Kilo ships with specialized agents you switch between depending on the task. You can also build your own custom agents.

- **Code** - The default. Implements and edits code from natural language.
- **Plan** - Designs architecture and writes implementation plans before any code gets written.
- **Ask** - Answers questions about your codebase without touching any files.
- **Debug** - Troubleshoots and traces issues.
- **Review** - Reviews your changes and surfaces issues across performance, security, style, and test coverage.

Learn more about [agents and custom agents](https://kilo.ai/docs/code-with-ai/agents/using-agents).

## features

- **Code generation** from natural language, across multiple files.
- **Inline autocomplete** with ghost-text suggestions and tab to accept.
- **Self-checking** so the agent reviews and corrects its own work.
- **Terminal and browser control** to run commands and automate the web.
- **MCP marketplace** to find and wire up MCP servers that extend what the agent can do.
- **500+ models** with mid-task switching, so you can match latency, cost, and reasoning to the job.

### Autonomous Mode (CI/CD)

Run `kilo run` with `--auto` for fully autonomous operation with no prompts, built for CI/CD pipelines:

```bash
kilo run --auto "run tests and fix any failures"
```

`--auto` disables all permission prompts and lets the agent execute any action without confirmation. Only use it in trusted environments.

Build Real-Time Knowledge Graphs for AI Agents

## features

Traditional RAG approaches often rely on batch processing and static data summarization, making them inefficient for
frequently changing data. Graphiti addresses these challenges by providing:

- **Temporal Fact Management:** Facts have validity windows. When information changes, old facts are
  invalidated — not deleted. Query what's true now, or what was true at any point in time.
- **Episodes & Provenance:** Every entity and relationship traces back to the episodes (raw data) that produced it.
  Full lineage from derived fact to source.
- **Prescribed & Learned Ontology:** Define entity and edge types upfront via Pydantic models (prescribed), or let
  structure emerge from your data (learned). Start simple, evolve as patterns appear.
- **Incremental Graph Construction:** New data integrates immediately without batch recomputation. The graph evolves
  in real-time as episodes are ingested.
- **Hybrid Retrieval:** Combines semantic embeddings, keyword (BM25), and graph traversal for low-latency,
  high-precision queries without reliance on LLM summarization.
- **Scalability:** Efficiently manages large datasets with parallel processing, pluggable graph backends, suitable
  for enterprise workloads.

## Graphiti vs. GraphRAG

| Aspect | GraphRAG | Graphiti |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Primary Use** | Static document summarization | Dynamic, evolving context for agents |
| **Data Handling** | Batch-oriented processing | Continuous, incremental updates |
| **Knowledge Structure** | Entity clusters & community summaries | Temporal context graph — entities, facts with validity windows, episodes, communities |
| **Retrieval Method** | Sequential LLM summarization | Hybrid semantic, keyword, and graph-based search |
| **Adaptability** | Low | High |
| **Temporal Handling** | Basic timestamp tracking | Explicit bi-temporal tracking with automatic fact invalidation |
| **Contradiction Handling** | LLM-driven summarization judgments | Automatic fact invalidation with temporal history preserved |
| **Query Latency** | Seconds to tens of seconds | Typically sub-second latency |
| **Custom Entity Types** | No | Yes, customizable via Pydantic models |
| **Scalability** | Moderate | High, optimized for large datasets |

Graphiti is specifically designed to address the challenges of dynamic and frequently updated datasets, making it
particularly suitable for applications requiring real-time interaction and precise historical queries.

## installation

Requirements:

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Neo4j 5.26 / FalkorDB 1.1.2 / Amazon Neptune Database Cluster or Neptune Analytics Graph + Amazon OpenSearch
  Serverless collection (serves as the full text search backend) / Kuzu 0.11.2 (**deprecated**, see below)
- OpenAI API key (Graphiti defaults to OpenAI for LLM inference and embedding)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Graphiti works best with LLM services that support Structured Output (such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini).
> Using other services may result in incorrect output schemas and ingestion failures. This is particularly
> problematic when using smaller models.

Optional:

- Google Gemini, Anthropic, or Groq API key (for alternative LLM providers)

> [!TIP]
> The simplest way to install Neo4j is via [Neo4j Desktop](https://neo4j.com/download/). It provides a user-friendly
> interface to manage Neo4j instances and databases.
> Alternatively, you can use FalkorDB on-premises via Docker and instantly start with the quickstart example:
> ```
> docker run -p 6379:6379 -p 3000:3000 -it --rm falkordb/falkordb:latest
> ```

```bash
pip install graphiti-core
```

or

```bash
uv add graphiti-core
```

### Installing with FalkorDB Support

If you plan to use FalkorDB as your graph database backend, install with the FalkorDB extra:

```bash
pip install graphiti-core[falkordb]

# or with uv
uv add graphiti-core[falkordb]

# or embedded version (requires Python 3.12+)
pip install graphiti-core[falkordblite]
# or with uv
uv add graphiti-core[falkordblite]
```

### Installing with Kuzu Support

> [!WARNING]
> **Kuzu is deprecated** and will be removed in a future release — the upstream Kuzu project is no longer
> maintained. New projects should use Neo4j or FalkorDB. The driver still ships for now but emits a
> `DeprecationWarning`.

If you plan to use Kuzu as your graph database backend, install with the Kuzu extra:

```bash
pip install graphiti-core[kuzu]

# or with uv
uv add graphiti-core[kuzu]
```

### Installing with Amazon Neptune Support

If you plan to use Amazon Neptune as your graph database backend, install with the Amazon Neptune extra:

```bash
pip install graphiti-core[neptune]

# or with uv
uv add graphiti-core[neptune]
```

### You can also install optional LLM providers as extras:

```bash
# Install with Anthropic support
pip install graphiti-core[anthropic]

# Install with Groq support
pip install graphiti-core[groq]

# Install with Google Gemini support
pip install graphiti-core[google-genai]

# Install with multiple providers
pip install graphiti-core[anthropic,groq,google-genai]

# Install with FalkorDB and LLM providers
pip install graphiti-core[falkordb,anthropic,google-genai]

# Install with Amazon Neptune
pip install graphiti-core[neptune]
```

## Default to Low Concurrency; LLM Provider 429 Rate Limit Errors

Graphiti's ingestion pipelines are designed for high concurrency. By default, concurrency is set low to avoid LLM
Provider 429 Rate Limit Errors. If you find Graphiti slow, please increase concurrency as described below.

Concurrency controlled by the `SEMAPHORE_LIMIT` environment variable. By default, `SEMAPHORE_LIMIT` is set to `10`
concurrent operations to help prevent `429` rate limit errors from your LLM provider. If you encounter such errors, try
lowering this value.

If your LLM provider allows higher throughput, you can increase `SEMAPHORE_LIMIT` to boost episode ingestion
performance.

## Quick Start

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Graphiti defaults to using OpenAI for LLM inference and embedding. Ensure that an `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in your
> environment.
> Support for Anthropic, Gemini, and Groq is available, too. Other LLM providers — both hosted OpenAI-compatible APIs
> (DeepSeek, Together, OpenRouter, …) and local servers (Ollama, vLLM, llama.cpp, LM Studio) — may be used via their
> OpenAI-compatible endpoints; see
> [Using Graphiti with OpenAI-compatible providers and local LLMs](#using-graphiti-with-openai-compatible-providers-and-local-llms).

For a complete work

## configuration

In addition to the Neo4j and OpenAi-compatible credentials, Graphiti also has a few optional environment variables.
If you are using one of our supported models, such as Anthropic or Voyage models, the necessary environment variables
must be set.

### Database Configuration

Database names are configured directly in the driver constructors:

- **Neo4j**: Database name defaults to `neo4j` (hardcoded in Neo4jDriver)
- **FalkorDB**: Database name defaults to `default_db` (hardcoded in FalkorDriver)

As of v0.17.0, if you need to customize your database configuration, you can instantiate a database driver and pass it
to the Graphiti constructor using the `graph_driver` parameter.

#### Neo4j with Custom Database Name

```python
from graphiti_core import Graphiti
from graphiti_core.driver.neo4j_driver import Neo4jDriver

# Create a Neo4j driver with custom database name
driver = Neo4jDriver(
    uri="bolt://localhost:7687",
    user="neo4j",
    password="password",
    database="my_custom_database"  # Custom database name
)

# Pass the driver to Graphiti
graphiti = Graphiti(graph_driver=driver)
```

#### FalkorDB with Custom Database Name

```python
from graphiti_core import Graphiti
from graphiti_core.driver.falkordb_driver import FalkorDriver

# Create a FalkorDB driver with custom database name
driver = FalkorDriver(
    host="localhost",
    port=6379,
    username="falkor_user",  # Optional
    password="falkor_password",  # Optional
    database="my_custom_graph"  # Custom database name
)

# Or use embedded FalkorDB Lite (requires Python 3.12+)
# from redislite.async_falkordb_client import AsyncFalkorDB
# falkordb_client = AsyncFalkorDB(dbfilename='/path/to/database.db')
# driver = FalkorDriver(falkor_db=falkordb_client)

# Pass the driver to Graphiti
graphiti = Graphiti(graph_driver=driver)
```

#### Kuzu

> [!WARNING]
> Kuzu is **deprecated** (upstream project unmaintained) and will be removed in a future release. Prefer Neo4j or
> FalkorDB.

```python
from graphiti_core import Graphiti
from graphiti_core.driver.kuzu_driver import KuzuDriver

# Create a Kuzu driver
driver = KuzuDriver(db="/tmp/graphiti.kuzu")

# Pass the driver to Graphiti
graphiti = Graphiti(graph_driver=driver)
```

#### Amazon Neptune

```python
from graphiti_core import Graphiti
from graphiti_core.driver.neptune_driver import NeptuneDriver

# Create a Neptune driver
driver = NeptuneDriver(
    host='<NEPTUNE_ENDPOINT>',
    aoss_host='<AMAZON_OPENSEARCH_SERVERLESS_HOST>',
    port=8182,      # Optional, defaults to 8182
    aoss_port=443,  # Optional, defaults to 443
)

# Pass the driver to Graphiti
graphiti = Graphiti(graph_driver=driver)
```

## Using Graphiti with Azure OpenAI

Graphiti supports Azure OpenAI for both LLM inference and embeddings using Azure's OpenAI v1 API compatibility layer.

## tools

azure_client = AsyncOpenAI(
    base_url="https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com/openai/v1/",
    api_key="your-api-key",
)

# Create LLM and Embedder clients
llm_client = AzureOpenAILLMClient(
    azure_client=azure_client,
    config=LLMConfig(model="gpt-5-mini", small_model="gpt-5-mini")  # Your Azure deployment name
)
embedder_client = AzureOpenAIEmbedderClient(
    azure_client=azure_client,
    model="text-embedding-3-small"  # Your Azure embedding deployment name
)

# Initialize Graphiti with Azure OpenAI clients
graphiti = Graphiti(
    "bolt://localhost:7687",
    "neo4j",
    "password",
    llm_client=llm_client,
    embedder=embedder_client,
)

# Now you can use Graphiti with Azure OpenAI
```

**Key Points:**

- Use the standard `AsyncOpenAI` client with Azure's v1 API endpoint format:
  `https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com/openai/v1/`
- The deployment names (e.g., `gpt-5-mini`, `text-embedding-3-small`) should match your Azure OpenAI deployment names
- See `examples/azure-openai/` for a complete working example

Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your actual Azure OpenAI credentials and deployment names.

## Using Graphiti with Google Gemini

Graphiti supports Google's Gemini models for LLM inference, embeddings, and cross-encoding/reranking. To use Gemini,
you'll need to configure the LLM client, embedder, and the cross-encoder with your Google API key.

Install Graphiti:

```bash
uv add "graphiti-core[google-genai]"

# or

pip install "graphiti-core[google-genai]"
```

```python
from graphiti_core import Graphiti
from graphiti_core.llm_client.gemini_client import GeminiClient, LLMConfig
from graphiti_core.embedder.gemini import GeminiEmbedder, GeminiEmbedderConfig
from graphiti_core.cross_encoder.gemini_reranker_client import GeminiRerankerClient

# Google API key configuration
api_key = "<your-google-api-key>"

# Initialize Graphiti with Gemini clients
graphiti = Graphiti(
    "bolt://localhost:7687",
    "neo4j",
    "password",
    llm_client=GeminiClient(
        config=LLMConfig(
            api_key=api_key,
            model="gemini-2.0-flash"
        )
    ),
    embedder=GeminiEmbedder(
        config=GeminiEmbedderConfig(
            api_key=api_key,
            embedding_model="embedding-001"
        )
    ),
    cross_encoder=GeminiRerankerClient(
        config=LLMConfig(
            api_key=api_key,
            model="gemini-2.5-flash-lite"
        )
    )
)

# Now you can use Graphiti with Google Gemini for all components
```

The Gemini reranker uses the `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` model by default, which is optimized for
cost-effective and low-latency classification tasks. It uses the same boolean classification approach as the OpenAI
reranker, leveraging Gemini's log probabilities feature to rank passage relevance.

## Using Graphiti with OpenAI-compatible providers and local LLMs

Graphiti can use any OpenAI-compatible `/v1` endpoint for LLM inference via `OpenAIGenericClient` — both **hosted
providers** (DeepSeek, Together, OpenRouter, Fireworks, etc.) and **local servers** (Ollama, vLLM, llama.cpp, LM
Studio). Local servers are ideal for privacy-focused applications or avoiding API costs. The example below uses Ollama;
for any other provider, point `base_url` at its endpoint and set the appropriate `api_key` and `model`.

**Note:** Use `OpenAIGenericClient` (not `OpenAIClient`) for these endpoints. It is optimized for local models with a
higher default max token limit (16K vs 8K) and handles structured outputs across compatible providers.

Install the models:

```bash
ollama pull deepseek-r1:7b # LLM
ollama pull nomic-embed-text # embeddings
```

```python
from graphiti_core import Graphiti
from graphiti_core.llm_client.config import LLMConfig
from graphiti_core.llm_client.openai_generic_client import OpenAIGenericClient
from graphiti_core.embedder.openai import OpenAIEmbedder, OpenAIEmbedderConfig
from graphiti_core.cross_encoder.openai_reranker_client import OpenAIRer

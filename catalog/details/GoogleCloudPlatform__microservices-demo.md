# GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo

Sample cloud-first application with 10 microservices showcasing Kubernetes, Istio, and gRPC.

## installation

1. Ensure you have the following requirements:
   - [Google Cloud project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#creating_a_project).
   - Shell environment with `gcloud`, `git`, and `kubectl`.

2. Clone the latest major version.

   ```sh
   git clone --depth 1 --branch v0 https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo.git
   cd microservices-demo/
   ```

   The `--depth 1` argument skips downloading git history.

3. Set the Google Cloud project and region and ensure the Google Kubernetes Engine API is enabled.

   ```sh
   export PROJECT_ID=<PROJECT_ID>
   export REGION=us-central1
   gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com \
     --project=${PROJECT_ID}
   ```

   Substitute `<PROJECT_ID>` with the ID of your Google Cloud project.

4. Create a GKE cluster and get the credentials for it.

   ```sh
   gcloud container clusters create-auto online-boutique \
     --project=${PROJECT_ID} --region=${REGION}
   ```

   Creating the cluster may take a few minutes.

5. Deploy Online Boutique to the cluster.

   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f ./release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml
   ```

6. Wait for the pods to be ready.

   ```sh
   kubectl get pods
   ```

   After a few minutes, you should see the Pods in a `Running` state:

   ```
   NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

   shippingservice-6ccc89f8fd-v686r         1/1     Running   0          2m58s
   ```

7. Access the web frontend in a browser using the frontend's external IP.

   ```sh
   kubectl get service frontend-external | awk '{print $4}'
   ```

   Visit `http://EXTERNAL_IP` in a web browser to access your instance of Online Boutique.

8. Congrats! You've deployed the default Online Boutique. To deploy a different variation of Online Boutique (e.g., with Google Cloud Operations tracing, Istio, etc.), see [Deploy Online Boutique variations with Kustomize](#deploy-online-boutique-variations-with-kustomize).

9. Once you are done with it, delete the GKE cluster.

   ```sh
   gcloud container clusters delete online-boutique \
     --project=${PROJECT_ID} --region=${REGION}
   ```

   Deleting the cluster may take a few minutes.

## configuration

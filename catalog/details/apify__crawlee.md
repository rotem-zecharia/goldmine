# apify/crawlee

Crawlee—A web scraping and browser automation library for Node.js to build reliable crawlers. In JavaScript and TypeScript. Extract data for AI, LLMs, RAG, or GPTs. Download HTML, PDF, JPG, PNG, and o

## installation

We recommend visiting the [Introduction tutorial](https://crawlee.dev/js/docs/introduction) in Crawlee documentation for more information.

> Crawlee requires **Node.js 16 or higher**.

### With Crawlee CLI

The fastest way to try Crawlee out is to use the **Crawlee CLI** and choose the **Getting started example**. The CLI will install all the necessary dependencies and add boilerplate code for you to play with.

```bash
npx crawlee create my-crawler
```

```bash
cd my-crawler
npm start
```

### Manual installation
If you prefer adding Crawlee **into your own project**, try the example below. Because it uses `PlaywrightCrawler` we also need to install [Playwright](https://playwright.dev). It's not bundled with Crawlee to reduce install size.

```bash
npm install crawlee playwright
```

```js
import { PlaywrightCrawler, Dataset } from 'crawlee';

// PlaywrightCrawler crawls the web using a headless
// browser controlled by the Playwright library.
const crawler = new PlaywrightCrawler({
    // Use the requestHandler to process each of the crawled pages.
    async requestHandler({ request, page, enqueueLinks, log }) {
        const title = await page.title();
        log.info(`Title of ${request.loadedUrl} is '${title}'`);

        // Save results as JSON to ./storage/datasets/default
        await Dataset.pushData({ title, url: request.loadedUrl });

        // Extract links from the current page
        // and add them to the crawling queue.
        await enqueueLinks();
    },
    // Uncomment this option to see the browser window.
    // headless: false,
});

// Add first URL to the queue and start the crawl.
await crawler.run(['https://crawlee.dev']);
```

By default, Crawlee stores data to `./storage` in the current working directory. You can override this directory via Crawlee configuration. For details, see [Configuration guide](https://crawlee.dev/js/docs/guides/configuration), [Request storage](https://crawlee.dev/js/docs/guides/request-storage) and [Result storage](https://crawlee.dev/js/docs/guides/result-storage).

### Installing pre-release versions

We provide automated beta builds for every merged code change in Crawlee. You can find them in the npm [list of releases](https://www.npmjs.com/package/crawlee?activeTab=versions). If you want to test new features or bug fixes before we release them, feel free to install a beta build like this:

```bash
npm install crawlee@next
```

If you also use the [Apify SDK](https://github.com/apify/apify-sdk-js), you need to specify dependency overrides in your `package.json` file so that you don't end up with multiple versions of Crawlee installed:

```json
{
    "overrides": {
       "apify": {
           "@crawlee/core": "$crawlee",
           "@crawlee/types": "$crawlee",
           "@crawlee/utils": "$crawlee"
       }
    }
}
```

## tools

Crawlee is open-source and runs anywhere, but since it's developed by [Apify](https://apify.com), it's easy to set up on the Apify platform and run in the cloud. Visit the [Apify SDK website](https://sdk.apify.com) to learn more about deploying Crawlee to the Apify platform.

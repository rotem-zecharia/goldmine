Delightful JavaScript Testing.

## installation

<!-- copied from Getting Started docs, links updated to point to Jest website -->

Install Jest using [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/jest):

```bash
yarn add --dev jest
```

Or [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest):

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest
```

Note: Jest documentation uses `yarn` commands, but `npm` will also work. You can compare `yarn` and `npm` commands in the [yarn docs, here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/migrating-from-npm#toc-cli-commands-comparison).

Let's get started by writing a test for a hypothetical function that adds two numbers. First, create a `sum.js` file:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
module.exports = sum;
```

Then, create a file named `sum.test.js`. This will contain our actual test:

```javascript
const sum = require('./sum');

test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
  expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);

## configuration

Based on your project, Jest will ask you a few questions and will create a basic configuration file with a short description for each option:

```bash
yarn create jest
```

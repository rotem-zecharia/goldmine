# assafelovic/gpt-researcher

An autonomous agent that conducts deep research on any data using any LLM providers

## features

- Objective conclusions for manual research can take weeks, requiring vast resources and time.
- LLMs trained on outdated information can hallucinate, becoming irrelevant for current research tasks.
- Current LLMs have token limitations, insufficient for generating long research reports.
- Limited web sources in existing services lead to misinformation and shallow results.
- Selective web sources can introduce bias into research tasks.

## installation

Extend Claude's deep research capabilities by installing GPT Researcher as a [Claude Skill](https://skills.sh/assafelovic/gpt-researcher/gpt-researcher):

```bash
npx skills add assafelovic/gpt-researcher
```

Once installed, Claude can leverage GPT Researcher's deep research capabilities directly within your conversations.

## Architecture

The core idea is to utilize 'planner' and 'execution' agents. The planner generates research questions, while the execution agents gather relevant information. The publisher then aggregates all findings into a comprehensive report.

<img align="center" height="600" src="https://github.com/assafelovic/gpt-researcher/assets/13554167/4ac896fd-63ab-4b77-9688-ff62aafcc527">
</div>

Steps:
* Create a task-specific agent based on a research query.
* Generate questions that collectively form an objective opinion on the task.
* Use a crawler agent for gathering information for each question.
* Summarize and source-track each resource.
* Filter and aggregate summaries into a final research report.

## tools

```python
...
from gpt_researcher import GPTResearcher

query = "why is Nvidia stock going up?"
researcher = GPTResearcher(query=query)
# Conduct research on the given query
research_result = await researcher.conduct_research()
# Write the report
report = await researcher.write_report()
...
```

**For more examples and configurations, please refer to the [PIP documentation](https://docs.gptr.dev/docs/gpt-researcher/gptr/pip-package) page.**

### 🔧 MCP Client
GPT Researcher supports MCP integration to connect with specialized data sources like GitHub repositories, databases, and custom APIs. This enables research from data sources alongside web search.

```bash
export RETRIEVER=tavily,mcp  # Enable hybrid web + MCP research
```

```python
from gpt_researcher import GPTResearcher
import asyncio
import os

async def mcp_research_example():
    # Enable MCP with web search
    os.environ["RETRIEVER"] = "tavily,mcp"
    
    researcher = GPTResearcher(
        query="What are the top open source web research agents?",
        mcp_configs=[
            {
                "name": "github",
                "command": "npx",
                "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
                "env": {"GITHUB_TOKEN": os.getenv("GITHUB_TOKEN")}
            }
        ]
    )
    
    research_result = await researcher.conduct_research()
    report = await researcher.write_report()
    return report
```

## 🍌 Inline Image Generation

GPT Researcher can automatically generate and embed AI-created illustrations in your research reports using Google's Gemini models (Nano Banana).

```bash
# Enable in your .env file
IMAGE_GENERATION_ENABLED=true
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
IMAGE_GENERATION_MODEL=models/gemini-2.5-flash-image
```

When enabled, the system will:
1. Analyze your research context to identify visualization opportunities
2. Pre-generate 2-3 relevant images during the research phase
3. Embed them inline as the report is written

Images are generated with dark-mode styling that matches the GPT Researcher UI, featuring professional infographic aesthetics with teal accents.

[Learn more about Image Generation](https://docs.gptr.dev/docs/gpt-researcher/gptr/image_generation) in our documentation.

## ✨ Deep Research

GPT Researcher now includes Deep Research - an advanced recursive research workflow that explores topics with agentic depth and breadth. This feature employs a tree-like exploration pattern, diving deeper into subtopics while maintaining a comprehensive view of the research subject.

- 🌳 Tree-like exploration with configurable depth and breadth
- ⚡️ Concurrent processing for faster results
- 🤝 Smart context management across research branches
- ⏱️ Takes ~5 minutes per deep research
- 💰 Costs ~$0.4 per research (using `o3-mini` on "high" reasoning effort)

[Learn more about Deep Research](https://docs.gptr.dev/docs/gpt-researcher/gptr/deep_research) in our documentation.

## Run with Docker

> **Step 1** - [Install Docker](https://docs.gptr.dev/docs/gpt-researcher/getting-started/getting-started-with-docker)

> **Step 2** - Clone the '.env.example' file, add your API Keys to the cloned file and save the file as '.env'

> **Step 3** - Within the docker-compose file comment out services that you don't want to run with Docker.

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

If that doesn't work, try running it without the dash:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

> **Step 4** - By default, if you haven't uncommented anything in your docker-compose file, this flow will start 2 processes:
 - the Python server running on localhost:8000<br>
 - the React app running on localhost:3000<br>

Visit localhost:3000 on any browser and enjoy researching!

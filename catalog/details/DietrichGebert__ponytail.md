# DietrichGebert/ponytail

Makes your AI agent think like the laziest senior dev in the room. The best code is the code you never wrote.

## installation

**Claude Code**, as two separate prompts:

```
/plugin marketplace add DietrichGebert/ponytail
```
```
/plugin install ponytail@ponytail
```

**Codex:**

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add DietrichGebert/ponytail
codex plugin add ponytail@ponytail
```

Then open `/hooks` in Codex, trust its two lifecycle hooks, and start a new thread.

**Any other agent:** copy [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) into your project, or ask your agent to install [`skills/ponytail/SKILL.md`](skills/ponytail/SKILL.md) as a skill. Step by step for Copilot, Cursor, OpenCode, Gemini and the rest: **[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)**.

That was it. He'd be proud. He won't say it.

Active every session, with a handful of commands (see [Commands](#commands)). `/ponytail ultra` exists for when the codebase has wronged you personally. Startup and mode-change text shows the current mode.

Only install ponytail from `DietrichGebert/ponytail` on GitHub or `@dietrichgebert/ponytail` on npm. It never ships `.exe` or `.dll` files; a copy that does is not mine.

## Before / after

You ask for a date picker. Your agent installs flatpickr, writes a wrapper component, adds a stylesheet, and starts a discussion about timezones.

With ponytail:

```html
<!-- ponytail: browser has one -->
<input type="date">
```

## How it works

Before writing code, the agent stops at the first rung that holds:

```
1. Does this need to exist?   → no: skip it (YAGNI)
2. Already in this codebase?  → reuse it, don't rewrite
3. Stdlib does it?            → use it
4. Native platform feature?   → use it
5. Installed dependency?      → use it
6. One line?                  → one line
7. Only then: the minimum that works
```

The ladder runs *after* it understands the problem, not instead of it: it reads the code the change touches and traces the real flow before picking a rung. Lazy about the solution, never about reading.

Lazy, not negligent: trust-boundary validation, data-loss handling, security, and accessibility are never on the chopping block.

## tools

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/ponytail [lite \| full \| ultra \| off]` | Set the intensity, or turn it off. No argument switches ponytail on at the default level if it is off, and otherwise reports the current level. |
| `/ponytail-review` | Review the current diff for over-engineering, hands back a delete-list. Name a target in plain words to narrow or widen it: `uncommitted`, `staged`, `branch`, or a PR link. |
| `/ponytail-audit` | Audit the whole repo for over-engineering, not just the diff. |
| `/ponytail-debt` | Harvest the `ponytail:` shortcuts you've deferred into a ledger, so "later" doesn't become "never". |
| `/ponytail-gain` | Show the measured impact scoreboard (less code, less cost, more speed) from the benchmark. |
| `/ponytail-help` | Quick reference for the commands above. |

Commands need a skill-capable host (Claude Code, Codex, Devin CLI, OpenCode, Gemini, pi, Swival, Hermes Agent, Qoder, Grok Build). In Codex CLI and the IDE extension they're skills; invoke with `$ponytail-review`. Cursor with the [hooks](INSTALL.md#cursor) gets `/ponytail` level switching only, typed as a plain message. The instruction-only adapters (Cursor's rule file, Windsurf, Cline, Copilot, Kiro, Antigravity) load the always-on ruleset without the commands.

## Numbers

The honest measurement is a real agent doing real work: a headless Claude Code session editing [tiangolo's full-stack-fastapi-template](https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template) (a real FastAPI + React repo), scored on the `git diff` it leaves behind. Twelve feature tickets, the same agent with and without the skill, n=4, Haiku 4.5.

  <img src="assets/benchmark-agentic.svg" width="860" alt="Each arm as a percent of the no-skill baseline across LOC, tokens, cost and time (Haiku 4.5). ponytail is lowest on every metric (LOC 46%, tokens 78%, cost 80%, time 73%); caveman rises above 100% on tokens, cost and time; yagni-oneliner LOC 67%. Safety, separate adversarial tier: baseline, caveman and ponytail 100%, yagni-oneliner 95%.">
</p>

| vs no-skill baseline | LOC | tokens | cost | time | safe |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| **ponytail** | **-54%** | **-22%** | **-20%** | **-27%** | **100%** |
| caveman (terse-prose control) | -20% | +7% | +3% | +2% | 100% |
| "YAGNI + one-liners" prompt | -33% | -14% | -21% | -30% | 95% |

ponytail is the only arm that cuts every metric, and the only one that stays fully safe while doing it. The cut is biggest where there is a real over-build trap (date picker 404 to 23 lines, color picker 287 to 23, because it reaches for a native `<input>` instead of a component) and near zero on code that is already minimal.

<summary><strong>Older single-shot numbers (isolated generation)</strong></summary>

Five everyday tasks, three models, three arms (no skill, [caveman](https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman), ponytail), ten runs, median reported. One prompt, one completion, counting lines of the answer:

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/benchmark-3model.svg" width="860" alt="Median lines of code per arm across Haiku, Sonnet and Opus">
</p>

This showed **80-94% less code**. [#126](https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail/issues/126) fairly pointed out that the bare-model baseline pads its answer with prose and options, so that gap is partly a conversational-baseline artifact. The agentic numbers above are the corrected, defensible version. Reproduce the single-shot run with `npx promptfoo eval -c benchmarks/promptfooconfig.yaml`.

**The rule was never "fewest tokens."** It is: write only what the task needs, and never cut validation, error handling, security, or accessibility. The code ends up small because it is necessary, not golfed. Lower cost and latency are a side effect on the models that follow the ladder; a terse reaso

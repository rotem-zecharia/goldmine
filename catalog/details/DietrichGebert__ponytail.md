# DietrichGebert/ponytail

Makes your AI agent think like the laziest senior dev in the room. The best code is the code you never wrote.

## installation

The most effort ponytail will ever ask of you:

The Claude Code and Codex plugins run two tiny Node.js lifecycle hooks, so `node` needs to be on your PATH (note for Nix/nvm users: it must be on the non-interactive shell's PATH). If it isn't, the skills still work, the always-on activation just stays quiet instead of erroring on every prompt.

## tools

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/ponytail [lite \| full \| ultra \| off]` | Set the intensity, or turn it off. No argument reports the current level. |
| `/ponytail-review` | Review the current diff for over-engineering, hands back a delete-list. |
| `/ponytail-audit` | Audit the whole repo for over-engineering, not just the diff. |
| `/ponytail-debt` | Harvest the `ponytail:` shortcuts you've deferred into a ledger, so "later" doesn't become "never". |
| `/ponytail-gain` | Show the measured impact scoreboard (less code, less cost, more speed) from the benchmark. |
| `/ponytail-help` | Quick reference for the commands above. |

Commands need a skill-capable host (Claude Code, Codex, Devin CLI, OpenCode, Gemini, pi, Swival, Hermes Agent, Qoder, Grok Build). In Codex they're skills, invoke with `@` (`@ponytail-review`). The instruction-only adapters (Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Copilot, Kiro, Antigravity) load the always-on ruleset without the commands.

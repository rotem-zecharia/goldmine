# doobidoo/mcp-memory-service

Open-source persistent memory for AI agent pipelines (LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen) and Claude. REST API + knowledge graph + autonomous consolidation.

## installation

cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8765

## features

| Without mcp-memory-service | With mcp-memory-service |
|---|---|
| Each agent run starts from zero | Agents retrieve prior decisions in 5ms |
| Memory is local to one graph/run | Memory is shared across all agents and runs |
| You manage Redis + Pinecone + glue code | One self-hosted service, zero cloud cost |
| No causal relationships between facts | Knowledge graph with typed edges (causes, fixes, contradicts) |
| Context window limits create amnesia | Autonomous consolidation compresses old memories |

**Key capabilities for agent pipelines:**
- **Framework-agnostic REST API** — 76 endpoints, no MCP client library needed
- **Knowledge graph** — agents share causal chains, not just facts
- **`X-Agent-ID` header** — auto-tag memories by agent identity for scoped retrieval
- **`conversation_id`** — bypass deduplication for incremental conversation storage
- **SSE events** — real-time notifications when any agent stores or deletes a memory
- **Embeddings run locally via ONNX** — memory never leaves your infrastructure

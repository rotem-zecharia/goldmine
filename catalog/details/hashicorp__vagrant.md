Vagrant is a tool for building and distributing development environments.

## installation

Package dependencies: Vagrant requires `bsdtar` and `curl` to be available on
your system PATH to run successfully.

For the quick-start, we'll bring up a development machine on
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) because it is free and works
on all major platforms. Vagrant can, however, work with almost any
system such as [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/), [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/), [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/), etc.

First, make sure your development machine has
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
installed. After this,
[download and install the appropriate Vagrant package for your OS](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).

To build your first virtual environment:

    vagrant init hashicorp/bionic64
    vagrant up

Note: The above `vagrant up` command will also trigger Vagrant to download the
`bionic64` box via the specified URL. Vagrant only does this if it detects that
the box doesn't already exist on your system.

# NVIDIA/SkillSpector

Security scanner for AI agent skills. Detect vulnerabilities, malicious patterns, security risks, prompt injection, data exfiltration, and supply-chain risks in Claude Code, Codex, and MCP skills befo

## features

AI agent skills (used by Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, etc.) execute with implicit trust and minimal vetting. Research shows that **26.1% of skills contain vulnerabilities** and **5.2% show likely malicious intent**.

SkillSpector helps you answer: **"Is this skill safe to install?"**

SkillSpector is part of the [NVIDIA Verified Skills pipeline](https://docs.nvidia.com/skills/), which scans, evaluates, and signs agent skills before publication. Skills that pass are published to the [NVIDIA skills catalog](https://github.com/NVIDIA/skills).

## installation

> **Open-source software notice:** This project will download and install additional third-party open source software projects. Review the license terms of these open source projects before use.

Create and activate a virtual environment first (all `make` targets assume the venv is active). Use **uv** or **pip**; the Makefile uses `uv` if available, otherwise `pip`.

**Quick install with uv (CLI-only):**

```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/skillspector.git

## configuration

uv venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate

## tools

```bash

## limitations

- **Non-English content**: May miss patterns in other languages
- **Image-based attacks**: Cannot analyze text in images
- **Encrypted/binary code**: Cannot analyze compiled or encrypted content
- **Runtime behavior**: Static analysis only, no dynamic execution
- **Offline SC4**: Without network access to `api.osv.dev`, SC4 uses a small static fallback list

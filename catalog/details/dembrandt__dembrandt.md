# dembrandt/dembrandt

Extract any website’s design system into tokens in seconds: logo, colors, typography, borders & more. One command.

## installation

```bash
npm install -g dembrandt
dembrandt install-browser        # one-time: fetches the matching Chromium
dembrandt dembrandt.com
```

The browser step is required. dembrandt drives Chromium through `playwright-core`,
which ships no browser binaries, so a fresh install has nothing to launch until you
run it. Skipping it fails with `browser engine not available`.

Or use npx without installing: `npx dembrandt dembrandt.com`. The browser step applies
here too: run `npx dembrandt install-browser` first. Browsers land in a shared
Playwright cache, so either route only needs it once.

Requires Node.js 18+

## What you get

- Colors (semantic, palette, CSS variables, gradients)
- Typography (fonts, sizes, weights, sources, font file URLs)
- Spacing (margin/padding scales)
- Borders (radius, widths, styles, colors)
- Shadows
- Motion (duration scale, easing curves, hover patterns per component type)
- Components (buttons, badges, inputs, links)
- Breakpoints
- Icons & frameworks

Playwright renders the page, dembrandt reads computed styles from the DOM, analyzes color usage and confidence, groups similar typography, detects spacing patterns, and returns design tokens.

## Common flags

```bash
dembrandt dembrandt.com --save-output   # Save JSON to output/dembrandt.com/TIMESTAMP.json
dembrandt dembrandt.com --dtcg          # W3C Design Tokens (DTCG) export, for Style Dictionary or Tokens Studio
dembrandt dembrandt.com --design-md     # DESIGN.md for AI agents
dembrandt dembrandt.com --tailwind      # Tailwind v4 @theme CSS, observed values only
dembrandt dembrandt.com --wcag          # WCAG 2.1 contrast, real DOM pairs with AA/AAA grades
dembrandt dembrandt.com --crawl 10      # Merge 10 pages into one output, cross-page confidence boosting
dembrandt dembrandt.com --slow          # 3x timeouts for JavaScript-heavy sites
```

Default is formatted terminal output only. Full flag reference in **[docs/usage.md](docs/usage.md)**: mobile and dark mode, browser selection and CDP, brand guide PDF, motion tokens, fingerprint options.

## Catch design drift in CI

Extract a preview deployment, compare against a committed baseline, fail the job when tokens moved:

```yaml
- uses: dembrandt/dembrandt@v0.28.0
  with:
    url: https://preview.example.com
    baseline: .dembrandt/baseline.json
```

The action annotates the PR with the drifted tokens. On any other runner the gate is just an exit code plus JSON: `dembrandt URL --compare baseline.json --json-only` exits 1 on drift and prints per-token `changes[]`. See **[docs/ci.md](docs/ci.md)** for the Action inputs, the platform-neutral gate, and the exit code table.

## Recipes

Copy a command, paste a prompt, get a result. Competitor benchmarking, WCAG audits, Figma token push, agentic design system builds. Filterable by role at **[dembrandt.com/recipes](https://www.dembrandt.com/recipes)**, with the basics in [docs/recipes.md](docs/recipes.md).

## AI Agent Integration (MCP)

Use Dembrandt as a tool in Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, or any MCP-compatible client. Ask your agent to "extract the color palette from dembrandt.com" and it calls Dembrandt automatically.

```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio dembrandt -- npx -y --package dembrandt dembrandt-mcp
```

Or add to your project's `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dembrandt": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "--package", "dembrandt", "dembrandt-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Available tools include `get_design_tokens`, `get_color_palette`, `get_typography`, `get_component_styles`, `get_surfaces`, `get_spacing`, and `get_brand_identity`, plus pure analysis tools (`compute_drift`, `get_findings`, `export_dtcg`, `generate_design_md`, `render_report`) and job-control tools. Extraction tools accept `mobile`, `cookie` (for authenticated pages), and `wcag` options.

Pair with **[dembrandt-skills](https://github.com/dembrandt/dembrandt-skills)** to give your agent UX intelligence on top of extracted tokens: hierarchy, accessibi

## limitations

- Dark mode requires `--dark-mode` flag (not automatically detected)
- Hover/focus states extracted from CSS (not fully interactive)
- Canvas/WebGL-rendered sites cannot be analyzed (no DOM to read)
- JavaScript-heavy sites require hydration time (8s initial + 4s stabilization)
- Some dynamically-loaded content may be missed
- Default viewport is 1920x1080 (use `--mobile` for 390x844 mobile viewport)

## Intended Use

Dembrandt reads publicly available CSS and computed styles from website DOMs for documentation, learning, and analysis of design systems you own or have permission to analyze.

Only run Dembrandt against sites whose Terms of Service permit automated access, or against your own properties. Do not use extracted material to reproduce third-party brand identities, logos, or trademarks. Respect robots.txt, rate limits, and copyright.

Dembrandt does not host, redistribute, or claim rights to any third-party brand assets.

## Sponsors

The CLI is MIT-licensed and free. Sponsorship funds the enforcement layer: a committed project-level token baseline, `--compare` and the ingest API for CI/CD drift gates, and the App platform (snapshot history, team drift dashboard, alerts to Slack, Linear, and GitHub).

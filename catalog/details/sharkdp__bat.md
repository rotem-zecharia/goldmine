# sharkdp/bat

A cat(1) clone with wings.

## tools

#### `fzf`

You can use `bat` as a previewer for [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf). To do this,
use `bat`'s `--color=always` option to force colorized output. You can also use `--line-range`
option to restrict the load times for long files:

```bash
fzf --preview "bat --color=always --style=numbers --line-range=:500 {}"
```

For more information, see [`fzf`'s `README`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#preview-window).

#### `find` or `fd`

You can use the `-exec` option of `find` to preview all search results with `bat`:

```bash
find … -exec bat {} +
```

If you happen to use [`fd`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd), you can use the `-X`/`--exec-batch` option to do the same:

```bash
fd … -X bat
```

#### `ripgrep`

With [`batgrep`](https://github.com/eth-p/bat-extras/blob/master/doc/batgrep.md), `bat` can be used as the printer for [`ripgrep`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) search results.

```bash
batgrep needle src/
```

#### `tail -f`

`bat` can be combined with `tail -f` to continuously monitor a given file with syntax highlighting.

```bash
tail -f /var/log/pacman.log | bat --paging=never -l log
```

Note that we have to switch off paging in order for this to work. We have also specified the syntax
explicitly (`-l log`), as it can not be auto-detected in this case.

#### `git`

You can combine `bat` with `git show` to view an older version of a given file with proper syntax
highlighting:

```bash
git show v0.6.0:src/main.rs | bat -l rs
```

#### `git diff`

You can combine `bat` with `git diff` to view lines around code changes with proper syntax
highlighting:
```bash
batdiff() {
    git diff --name-only --relative --diff-filter=d -z | xargs -0 bat --diff

## configuration

`bat` can also be customized with a configuration file. The location of the file is dependent
on your operating system. To get the default path for your system, call
```bash
bat --config-file
```

Alternatively, you can use `BAT_CONFIG_PATH` or `BAT_CONFIG_DIR` environment variables to point `bat`
to a non-default location of the configuration file or the configuration directory respectively:
```bash
export BAT_CONFIG_PATH="/path/to/bat/bat.conf"
export BAT_CONFIG_DIR="/path/to/bat"
```

A default configuration file can be created with the `--generate-config-file` option.
```bash
bat --generate-config-file
```

There is also now a systemwide configuration file, which is located under `/etc/bat/config` on
Linux and Mac OS and `C:\ProgramData\bat\config` on windows. If the system wide configuration
file is present, the content of the user configuration will simply be appended to it.

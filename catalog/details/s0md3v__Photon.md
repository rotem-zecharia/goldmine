# s0md3v/Photon

Incredibly fast crawler designed for OSINT.

## features

#### Data Extraction
Photon can extract the following data while crawling:

- URLs (in-scope & out-of-scope)
- URLs with parameters (`example.com/gallery.php?id=2`)
- Intel (emails, social media accounts, amazon buckets etc.)
- Files (pdf, png, xml etc.)
- Secret keys (auth/API keys & hashes)
- JavaScript files & Endpoints present in them
- Strings matching custom regex pattern
- Subdomains & DNS related data

The extracted information is saved in an organized manner or can be [exported as json](https://github.com/s0md3v/Photon/wiki/Usage#export-formatted-result).

#### Flexible
Control timeout, delay, add seeds, exclude URLs matching a regex pattern and other cool stuff.
The extensive range of [options](https://github.com/s0md3v/Photon/wiki/Usage) provided by Photon lets you crawl the web exactly the way you want.

#### Genius
Photon's smart thread management & refined logic gives you top notch performance.

Still, crawling can be resource intensive but Photon has some tricks up it's sleeves. You can fetch URLs archived by [archive.org](https://archive.org/) to be used as seeds by using `--wayback` option.

#### Plugins
- **[wayback](https://github.com/s0md3v/Photon/wiki/Usage#use-urls-from-archiveorg-as-seeds)**
- **[dnsdumpster](https://github.com/s0md3v/Photon/wiki/Usage#dumping-dns-data)**
- **[Exporter](https://github.com/s0md3v/Photon/wiki/Usage#export-formatted-result)**

#### Docker

Photon can be launched using a lightweight Python-Alpine (103 MB) Docker image.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/s0md3v/Photon.git
$ cd Photon
$ docker build -t photon .
$ docker run -it --name photon photon:latest -u google.com
```

To view results, you can either head over to the local docker volume, which you can find by running `docker inspect photon` or by mounting the target loot folder:

```bash
$ docker run -it --name photon -v "$PWD:/Photon/google.com" photon:latest -u google.com
```

#### Frequent & Seamless Updates
Photon is under heavy development and updates for fixing bugs. optimizing performance & new features are being rolled regularly.

If you would like to see features and issues that are being worked on, you can do that on [Development](https://github.com/s0md3v/Photon/projects/1) project board.

Updates can be installed & checked for with the `--update` option. Photon has seamless update capabilities which means you can update Photon without losing any of your saved data.

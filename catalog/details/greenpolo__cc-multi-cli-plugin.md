# greenpolo/cc-multi-cli-plugin

Claude Code plugin: delegate to Codex, Gemini, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Qwen CLIs via their native protocols (ACP, ASP). Use /gemini:research, /cursor:debug, /codex:execute, /copilot:review and mor

## installation

Paste into Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/greenpolo/cc-multi-cli-plugin
/plugin install multi@cc-multi-cli-plugin
/multi:setup
```

`/multi:setup` detects which CLIs you have, installs the matching sub-plugins, and wires Exa + Context7 MCPs into each.

## tools

Provider commands live under each CLI's namespace; the cross-cutting `/multi:*` commands operate the shared runtime.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/codex:execute` | Delegate a specific plan or plan step to Codex |
| `/codex:rescue` | Hand a stuck or open-ended problem to Codex for an independent investigation |
| `/codex:review` | Codex code review of your working tree or a branch (read-only) |
| `/codex:adversarial-review` | Adversarial design/code review — challenges the approach, not just the diff (read-only) |
| `/cursor:delegate` | Delegate an implementation task or plan step to Cursor (agentic; writes code; supports `--until-done`) |
| `/cursor:research` | Read-only external web/documentation research via Cursor |
| `/cursor:explore` | Read-only codebase exploration via Cursor |
| `/antigravity:research` | Deep external research with Antigravity (Gemini 3.7 Flash, read-only; experimental) |
| `/antigravity:explore` | Fast codebase exploration with Antigravity (Gemini 3.7 Flash, read-only; experimental) |
| `/opencode:delegate` | Delegate an implementation task to OpenCode (agentic; writes code; supports `--until-done`; default model: opencode/claude-opus-5 via Zen) |
| `/opencode:research` | Read-only external web/documentation research via OpenCode |
| `/opencode:explore` | Read-only codebase exploration via OpenCode |
| `/multi:setup` | One-shot wizard — detects CLIs, configures Exa + Context7 MCPs |
| `/multi:status` | Show active and recent background jobs for this repo |
| `/multi:result` | Show the stored final output for a finished job |
| `/multi:cancel` | Cancel an active background job |

Claude can also auto-dispatch the provider commands without you typing them.

All of them are interchangeable, and can be altered to whatever you want using the `customize` skill.

## limitations

These are upstream CLI quirks and current limitations. If you hit something not listed, check the companion's stderr (the forwarders append `2>&1`) — a bad model id, an auth failure, or a sandbox block surfaces there.

- **Cursor runs in headless `agent -p` mode by default** (ACP is opt-in — see [Transports](#transports)). On the headless path the adapter delivers the prompt on stdin, selects the model with `--model` (default `auto`), and parses `json`/`stream-json` output. MCP servers come from Cursor's own `~/.cursor/mcp.json`, which `/multi:setup` maintains (this holds on the ACP path too — the adapter passes no MCP servers in-protocol, so Cursor reads its own config either way).

- **Cursor's shell is slow/unreliable on Windows.** Cursor's terminal tool can stall or wait out a per-command timeout on Windows (host-PATH/WSL, open upstream). So `/cursor:delegate` does **not** run build/test verification itself — it lists the commands in a `## Verification` block and Claude runs them. File writes and web/codebase reads are unaffected.

- **Antigravity runs via the headless `agy` CLI (experimental).** Install the `agy` CLI (https://antigravity.google) and run `agy` once interactively to sign in — the desktop app is **not** required. `/multi:setup` reports whether `agy` is detected.

- **Antigravity reads its answer from a transcript, not stdout.** `agy`'s headless print mode (`agy -p`) currently emits nothing to stdout when piped (an upstream bug, google-antigravity/antigravity-cli#318; `--output-format stream-json` (agy >=1.1.8) is the coming workaround), so the adapter recovers the model's answer from `agy`'s on-disk conversation transcript. Consequences: read-only `research`/`explore` only (no write-`delegate`), the model is fixed to **Gemini 3.7 Flash** (no per-call `--model`), and there are no token-usage metrics on this path. This is a deliberate workaround pending the upstream stdout fix.

- **OpenCode has no `--read-only` flag.** For read-only roles (`/opencode:research`, `/opencode:explore`), the adapter enforces read-only by injecting a custom primary agent via `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` with write/edit/bash denied, plus an `OPENCODE_PERMISSION` deny floor. A stale bun `opencode.exe` may shadow the npm `.cmd` shim on Windows — the adapter never resolves to `opencode.exe`; set `OPENCODE_CLI_PATH` to force the right binary if needed.

- **OpenCode token offload: `anthropic/*` models = zero offload.** Calling OpenCode with an `anthropic/*` model routes through the same Claude subscription as Claude Code — no cost savings. Use `opencode/*` (Zen), `openai/*`, `google/*`, `github-copilot/*`, or `ollama/*` models for real offload. The adapter default is `opencode/claude-opus-5` (Zen, billed separately). Override with `OPENCODE_CLI_DEFAULT_MODEL`.

- **OpenCode `--effort` is not supported.** The `--effort` flag is Codex-only; OpenCode ignores it. `--until-done` is supported.

- **OpenCode MCP servers are not managed by `/multi:setup`.** OpenCode reads MCP configuration from its own `opencode.json`; use OpenCode's interactive wizard to wire Exa/Context7 there.

When upstream CLIs change behavior, the plugin's adapters absorb it — these notes track the current state.

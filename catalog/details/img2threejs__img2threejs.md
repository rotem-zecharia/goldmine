# img2threejs/img2threejs

Rebuild the object in a reference image as a code-only, procedural, quality-gated, animation-ready Three.js model. Token-efficient image-to-3D.

## features

You give it one reference image of an object. It produces a `THREE.Group` factory written in TypeScript that recreates that object from primitives, procedural shaders, and generated geometry — with a runtime hierarchy (pivots, sockets, colliders) so the result is ready to animate, not an inert lump.

It runs under Claude Code, Codex, or OpenCode. It is agent-agnostic: wherever the docs say "agent vision" or "agent browser tool", it uses whatever the host provides — native image reading, a browser MCP, the project preview, or a user-supplied screenshot.

### Subjects and detail accuracy

- **Objects and characters.** Each subject is classified `object`, `character`, or `hybrid`. Objects follow the hard-surface pipeline; characters route through an anatomy-aware track (head-unit proportions, facial landmarks, pose) documented in `grimoire/character/reconstruction.md`.
- **Detail-first analysis.** Before code generation the pipeline enumerates a `detailInventory` of identity-defining small details (gloss, bevel/rounding, screws/rivets, engraved or painted linework, contours, stains and wear). Every detail must map to a real component or material entry, and a strict-quality gate blocks generation until the inventory is complete. Taxonomy: `grimoire/intake/detail_inventory.md`.
- **Maximum likeness for a specific person or character.** An opt-in projection-first path fits a parametric template to image landmarks, de-lights the photo, camera-matches the render, and projects the reference onto the mesh. A single image cannot guarantee 100 percent likeness, so the pipeline reports per-region confidence and asks for more views when it matters. Details: `grimoire/character/likeness_maximization.md`.
- **Multi-view silhouette carving.** An opt-in `geometryDescriptor.visualHull` intersects at least two deterministic orthographic binary silhouettes into a bounded, welded voxel mesh. It records unseen areas as low-confidence rather than inventing hidden detail. Schema and runtime check: `grimoire/scripts.md`.
- **CS2 weapon review gates.** Knife and Glock-18 routes use family-specific component contracts. The review records exactness tier, family identity, painted-region and projection coverage, per-region confidence, approximation notes, and versioned review-scene metadata; component-coverage and map-stripped blockout gates prevent a convincing texture from standing in for real structure. See [`docs/cs2/review-gates.md`](docs/cs2/review-gates.md).
- **Resumable local workflow.** `forge/state.py` records an ordered, evidence-backed intake/pass checklist for generic, character, and CS2 profiles. `forge/next.py --state` resumes from that checklist while the existing spec, render, and review gates remain authoritative.
- **Material reference pipeline.** Every visible material region can be cropped, analyzed, resolved against the versioned Three.js material registry, fitted into `ObjectSculptSpec`, rendered from controlled camera views, and accepted only after a per-region comparison gate. See [`docs/materials/README.md`](docs/materials/README.md).
- **Python-assisted browser rendering.** Python may orchestrate camera batches, hashes, manifests, and deterministic diagnostics, but the target browser Three.js route remains the rendering authority. See [`grimoire/build/python_threejs_render_bridge.md`](grimoire/build/python_threejs_render_bridge.md).

## How it works

A staged sculpting pipeline turns the reference image into a spec, then generates and vision-reviews one build pass at a time — `blockout → structural → form → material → surface → lighting → interaction → optimization` — self-correcting until every identity-defining feature clears its threshold.

## installation

1. **Install** — place this folder in your skills directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/img2threejs/img2threejs.git ~/.claude/skills/img2threejs
   ```

   If you use more than one host, keep a single checkout and point each entrypoint at it as a
   symlink, so they cannot drift apart:

   ```text
   ~/.claude/skills/img2threejs -> <your checkout>
   ~/.codex/skills/img2threejs  -> <your checkout>
   ```

2. **Invoke** — in Claude Code, attach or point to an object image and run:

   ```
   /img2threejs Rebuild this object as a Three.js model, keep the proportions, angles, and colours.
   ```

   That is enough: the skill classifies the subject, runs the detail inventory, and gates every pass on its own.

3. **Follow the pipeline** — the skill validates the image, writes an assessment and spec, generates the factory pass by pass, and shows you a side-by-side comparison at each step until the render matches.

   For a multi-session reconstruction, create a local state index first:

   ```bash
   python3 forge/state.py init --reference <image> --profile character --spec object-sculpt-spec.json
   python3 forge/next.py --state .img2threejs/state.json
   ```

### Driving it harder

The one-liner leaves the judgement calls to the skill. When you already know what "correct" means for your subject, say so — each line below maps onto a real gate or artifact in the pipeline, so it changes what gets enforced rather than just adding adjectives:

```
/img2threejs Rebuild the subject in this image as a procedural Three.js model.

Fidelity   Hold proportions and silhouette to the reference. Enumerate the identity-defining
           details first — bevels and rounding, panel seams, fasteners, engraved or painted
           linework, gloss vs matte zones, wear — and drop any detail you cannot place on a
           real component instead of faking it.
Materials  Derive the finish class and gradient stops from the reference pixels, not from
           memory. Flag any colour that will not survive tone-mapping.
Runtime    Expose pivots and sockets for whatever should move, plus a userData.tick for a
           looping idle animation.
Gates      Run --strict-quality, and do not advance a pass until the side-by-side review
           passes. Report per-region confidence for anything the image cannot show.
```

Useful additions depending on the subject:

- **A specific person or character** — `Maximize likeness: fit the parametric template to the landmarks, de-light and camera-match the reference, then project it. Tell me which regions are inferred.`
- **An animal or creature** — `This is a creature, not a humanoid — use the quadruped body plan and the body-unit proportion system.`
- **A saturated anodized or candy finish** — `The coat is candy-coat, not gem-metal. Keep the hue; do not let the environment steal it.`
- **A cost ceiling** — `Stay at low effort and skip the presentation composer; I only need the evaluation render.`

The scripts run from the skill root and need only Python 3.10+ — nothing to install.

```bash
python3 forge/stage1_intake/probe_image.py <image>
python3 forge/stage2_spec/new_pre_spec_assessment.py "Name" --image <image> --out assessment.json
python3 forge/stage2_spec/new_sculpt_spec.py "Name" --image <image> --assessment assessment.json --out spec.json
python3 forge/stage2_spec/validate_sculpt_spec.py spec.json --strict-quality
python3 forge/stage3_build/generate_threejs_factory.py spec.json --out src/createObjectModel.ts
```

The factory generator repeats the strict-quality gate and is fail-closed: on failure it returns
`BLOCKED` with the spec artifact, failure metrics, causes, and next action, and does not write a
factory. `--allow-nonstrict` is only for explicit legacy test fixtures, never production output.

## Honesty about limits

A single image cannot reveal hidden sides or guarantee exact geometry. The skill states plainly when output is approximate, stylized, or low-poly, and infers unseen faces by mirroring visible ones rather than faking confidence. It is strong for hard-surface objects; characters are stylized reconstructions, not photoreal likeness. "This cannot reach the requested fidelity from this image" is a valid, expected result.

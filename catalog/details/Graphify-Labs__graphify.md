Turn any codebase, with its docs, SQL schemas, configs, and PDFs, into a queryable knowledge graph. A /graphify skill for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and Gemini CLI: local deterministic AST parsing, e

## features

What you get out of the box:

| Capability | What you get |
|---|---|
| **God nodes** | The most-connected concepts, so you see what everything flows through |
| **Communities** | The graph split into subsystems (Leiden), with LLM-free labels |
| **Cross-file links** | `calls` / `imports` / `inherits` / `mixes_in` resolved across ~40 languages via tree-sitter AST |
| **Query, path, explain** | Ask a question, trace the path between two things, or explain one concept, all against `graph.json` |
| **Rationale + doc refs** | `# NOTE:` / `# WHY:` comments and ADR/RFC citations become first-class nodes linked to the code |
| **Beyond code** | Docs, PDFs, images, and video/audio all map into the same graph |
| **Local-first** | Code is parsed locally with tree-sitter (no LLM, nothing leaves your machine); only the semantic pass over docs/media calls a backend, and only if you configure one |

Every system ran on the same harness with the same model and budgets, scored by a judge blind-validated against a second judge (90.6% agreement, Cohen's kappa 0.81). Full per-system tables, the code-intelligence result, and reproduction commands: **[BENCHMARKS.md](./BENCHMARKS.md)**.

## requirements

| Requirement | Minimum | Check | Install |
|---|---|---|---|
| Python | 3.10+ | `python --version` | [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) |
| uv *(recommended)* | any | `uv --version` | `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh \| sh` |
| pipx *(alternative)* | any | `pipx --version` | `pip install pipx` |

**macOS quick install (Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install python@3.12 uv
```

**Windows quick install:**
```powershell
winget install astral-sh.uv
```

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt install python3.12 python3-pip pipx

## installation

curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

## Install

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Official package:** The PyPI package is `graphifyy` (double-y). Other `graphify*` packages on PyPI are not affiliated. The CLI command is still `graphify`.

The official source repository is [Graphify-Labs/graphify](https://github.com/Graphify-Labs/graphify).

**Step 1 — install the package:**

```bash
# Recommended (isolated env; if 'graphify' isn't found after, run: uv tool update-shell):
uv tool install graphifyy

# Alternatives:
pipx install graphifyy
pip install graphifyy  # may need PATH setup — see note below
```

**Step 2 — register the skill with your AI assistant:**

```bash
graphify install
```

That's it. Open your AI assistant and type `/graphify .`

To install the assistant skill into the current repository instead of your user
profile, add `--project`:

```bash
graphify install --project
graphify install --project --platform codex
```

Project-scoped installs write under the current directory, for example
`.claude/skills/graphify/SKILL.md` or `.agents/skills/graphify/SKILL.md` (plus a
`references/` sidecar the skill loads on demand), and
print a `git add` hint for files that can be committed.
Per-platform commands that support project-scoped installs accept the same flag,
for example `graphify claude install --project` or `graphify codex install --project`.

> [!TIP]
> Hitting `command not found`, a `pip`-on-Mac/Windows issue, PowerShell quoting, `uvx` usage, git-hook PATH quirks, or strict mode? See **[Installation](https://docs.graphify.com/installation)** and **[Troubleshooting](https://docs.graphify.com/troubleshooting)**.

| Platform | Install command |
|----------|----------------|

| Aider | `graphify install --platform aider` |
| OpenClaw | `graphify install --platform claw` |
| Factory Droid | `graphify install --platform droid` |
| Trae | `graphify install --platform trae` |
| Trae CN | `graphify install --platform trae-cn` |
| Gemini CLI | `graphify install --platform gemini` |
| Hermes | `graphify install --platform hermes` |
| Kimi Code | `graphify install --platform kimi` |
| Amp | `graphify amp install` |
| Agent Skills (cross-framework) | `graphify install --platform agents` (alias `--platform skills`) |
| Kiro IDE/CLI | `graphify kiro install` |
| Pi coding agent | `graphify install --platform pi`, plus `graphify pi guard install` for the native guard |
| Cursor | `graphify cursor install` |
| Devin CLI | `graphify devin install` |
| Google Antigravity | `graphify antigravity install` |

Codex users also need `multi_agent = true` under `[features]` in `~/.codex/config.toml` for parallel extraction. CodeBuddy uses the same Agent tool and PreToolUse hook mechanism as Claude Code. Factory Droid uses the `Task` tool for parallel subagent dispatch. OpenClaw and Aider use sequential extraction (parallel agent support is still early on those platforms). Trae uses the Agent tool for parallel subagent dispatch and does **not** support `PreToolUse` hooks, so AGENTS.md is the always-on mechanism.

`--platform agents` (alias `--platform skills`) targets the generic cross-framework [Agent-Skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) locations: the spec's user-global `~/.agents/skills/` (read by `npx skills` and spec-compliant frameworks) for a global install, and `./.agents/skills/` for a project (`--project`) install. The bare `graphify install` stays single-plat

## tools

```bash
/graphify .                        # build graph for current folder
/graphify ./docs --update          # re-extract only changed files

/graphify . --cluster-only --exclude-hubs 99     # suppress utility super-hubs from god-node rankings
/graphify . --no-viz               # skip the HTML, just the report + JSON
/graphify . --wiki                 # build a markdown wiki from the graph
graphify export callflow-html      # Mermaid architecture/call-flow HTML (auto-regenerates on every git commit if hook is installed)

/graphify query "what connects auth to the database?"

graphify prs 42                    # deep dive on PR #42 with graph impact
graphify prs --triage              # AI ranks your review queue (uses whatever backend is configured)
graphify prs --conflicts           # PRs sharing graph communities — merge-order risk

## Ignoring files

graphify honors `.gitignore` and supports `--exclude` patterns and a project `.graphifyignore`. Details: **[Configuration](https://docs.graphify.com/reference/configuration)**.

## configuration

Create a `.graphifyrc` in the scan root for settings that belong to the project rather than to one run. One `key=value` per line; lines beginning with `#` are comments.

**Ambiguous extensions.** Some extensions mean different languages in different projects: `.inc` is PHP on pfSense, Pascal in a Delphi tree, SQL or assembly elsewhere; `.h` is C or C++; `.m` is Objective-C or MATLAB. graphify has to pick one global default, and when it picks wrong the file does not fail — it parses as the wrong language and yields a handful of incidental nodes, so the graph looks populated while the real symbols are missing. Declare what the extension means in your repo:

```
# .graphifyrc
# A language name:
language.inc=php
# Or an extension graphify already knows:
language.tpl=.ts

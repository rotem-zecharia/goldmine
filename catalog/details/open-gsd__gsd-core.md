# open-gsd/gsd-core

Git. Ship. Done - Core

## installation

```bash
npx @opengsd/gsd-core@latest
```

The installer prompts for your runtime (Claude Code, OpenCode, Antigravity CLI, Kimi CLI, Kilo, Codex, Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, and more) and whether to install globally or locally. The installer is required for cross-runtime compatibility — do not copy files from `agents/` or `commands/` directly.

On another runtime or without Node.js? See [Install on your runtime](docs/how-to/install-on-your-runtime.md).

Once installed, start a new project or onboard an existing repo:

```bash
/gsd-new-project   # greenfield project
/gsd-onboard       # existing codebase
```

New here? Follow [Your first project](docs/tutorials/your-first-project.md) for a guided walkthrough from install to first shipped phase, or [Onboarding an existing codebase](docs/tutorials/onboarding-an-existing-codebase.md) for brownfield setup.

## features

Most AI-coding setups fail at scale because context bloat silently degrades output quality, there is no shared memory between sessions, and nothing verifies that code actually works. GSD Core solves all three: heavy work runs in fresh subagents, structured artifacts like `STATE.md` and `CONTEXT.md` survive session boundaries, and the verify step walks through what was built and generates fix plans before a phase is declared done. See [docs/explanation/context-engineering.md](docs/explanation/context-engineering.md) for the full reasoning.

Troubleshooting? See [docs/how-to/recover-and-troubleshoot.md](docs/how-to/recover-and-troubleshoot.md).

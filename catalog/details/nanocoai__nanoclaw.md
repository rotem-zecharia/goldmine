# nanocoai/nanoclaw

A lightweight alternative to OpenClaw that runs in containers for security. Connects to WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Gmail and other messaging apps,, has memory, scheduled jobs, and runs direct

## features

[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) is an impressive project, but I wouldn't have been able to sleep if I had given complex software I didn't understand full access to my life. OpenClaw has nearly half a million lines of code, 53 config files, and 70+ dependencies. Its security is at the application level (allowlists, pairing codes) rather than true OS-level isolation. Everything runs in one Node process with shared memory.

NanoClaw provides that same core functionality, but in a codebase small enough to understand: one process and a handful of files. Agents run in their own Linux containers with filesystem isolation, not merely behind permission checks.

## installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nanocoai/nanoclaw.git nanoclaw-v2
cd nanoclaw-v2
bash nanoclaw.sh
```

`nanoclaw.sh` walks you from a fresh machine to a named agent you can message. It installs Node, pnpm, and Docker if missing, registers your Anthropic credential with OneCLI, builds the agent container, and pairs your first channel (Slack, Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp, iMessage, or a local CLI). If a step fails, Claude Code is invoked automatically to diagnose and resume from where it broke.

<details>
<summary><strong>Migrating from NanoClaw v1?</strong></summary>

Run from a fresh v2 checkout next to your v1 install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nanocoai/nanoclaw.git nanoclaw-v2
cd nanoclaw-v2
bash migrate-v2.sh
```

`migrate-v2.sh` finds your v1 install (sibling directory, or `NANOCLAW_V1_PATH=/path/to/nanoclaw`), migrates state into the v2 checkout, then `exec`s into Claude Code to finish the parts that need judgment (owner seeding, shared-memory migration, fork-customisation replay).

Run the script directly, not from inside a Claude session — the deterministic side needs interactive prompts and real shell I/O for Node/pnpm bootstrap, Docker, OneCLI, and the container build.

**What it does:** merges `.env`, seeds the v2 DB from `registered_groups`, copies group folders + session data + scheduled tasks, installs the channel adapters you select, copies channel auth state (including the Baileys keystore for WhatsApp — LID mapping is now resolved per-message by the Baileys v7 adapter, not migrated), builds the agent container.

**What it doesn't:** flip the system service. Pick *"switch to v2"* at the prompt, or do it manually after testing — your v1 install is left untouched.

See [docs/v1-to-v2-changes.md](docs/v1-to-v2-changes.md) for what's different and [docs/migration-dev.md](docs/migration-dev.md) for development notes.

## tools

Talk to your assistant with the trigger word (default: `@Andy`):

```
@Andy send an overview of the sales pipeline every weekday morning at 9am (has access to my Obsidian vault folder)
@Andy review the git history for the past week each Friday and update the README if there's drift
@Andy every Monday at 8am, compile news on AI developments from Hacker News and TechCrunch and message me a briefing
```

From a channel you own or administer, you can manage groups and tasks:
```
@Andy list all scheduled tasks across groups
@Andy pause the Monday briefing task
@Andy join the Family Chat group
```

## requirements

- macOS or Linux (Windows via WSL2)
- Node.js 22+ and pnpm 10+ (the installer will install both if missing)
- [Docker Desktop](https://docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (macOS/Windows) or Docker Engine (Linux)
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/download) for `/customize`, `/debug`, error recovery during setup, and all `/add-<channel>` skills

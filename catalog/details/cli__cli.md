### Build from source

See here on how to [build GitHub CLI from source](docs/install_source.md).

### GitHub Codespaces

To add GitHub CLI to your codespace, add the following to your [devcontainer file](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-features-to-a-devcontainer-file):

```json
"features": {
  "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/github-cli:1": {}
}
```

### GitHub Actions

[GitHub-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners) have the GitHub CLI pre-installed, which is updated weekly.

If a specific version is needed, your GitHub Actions workflow will need to install it based on the [macOS](#macos), [Linux & Unix](#linux--unix), or [Windows](#windows) instructions above.

For information on all pre-installed tools, see [`actions/runner-images`](https://github.com/actions/runner-images)

### Verification of binaries

Starting with v2.93.0, releases of `gh` are published as immutable releases. For more information, see [Immutable releases](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/concepts/supply-chain-security/immutable-releases).

Since version 2.50.0, `gh` has been producing [Build Provenance Attestation](https://github.blog/changelog/2024-06-25-artifact-attestations-is-generally-available/), enabling a cryptographically verifiable paper-trail back to the origin GitHub repository, git revision, and build instructions used. The build provenance attestations are signed and rely on Public Good [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/) for PKI.

There are two common ways to verify a downloaded release, depending on whether `gh` is already installed or not. If `gh` is installed, it's trivial to verify a new release:

- **Option 1: Using `gh` if already installed:**

  ```shell
  $ gh at verify -R cli/cli gh_2.62.0_macOS_arm64.zip
  Loaded digest sha256:fdb77f31b8a6dd23c3fd858758d692a45f7fc76383e37d475bdcae038df92afc for file://gh_2.62.0_macOS_arm64.zip
  Loaded 1 attestation from GitHub API
  ✓ Verification succeeded!

  sha256:fdb77f31b8a6dd23c3fd858758d692a45f7fc76383e37d475bdcae038df92afc was attested by:

  ```

- **Option 2: Using Sigstore [`cosign`](https://github.com/sigsto

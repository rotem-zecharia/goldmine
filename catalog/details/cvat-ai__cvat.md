- **[Manual & Auto-labeling](https://docs.cvat.ai/docs/annotation/manual-annotation/):** Annotate images, videos, and
  3D point clouds with bounding boxes, polygons, masks, keypoints, cuboids, tags, and more. Speed up labeling
  by connecting your own models for automatic annotation.
- **[Task Management](https://docs.cvat.ai/docs/workspace/):** Organize datasets into projects, split them into tasks
  and jobs, assign work to annotators, and track progress in real time.
- **[Collaboration](https://docs.cvat.ai/docs/account_management/user-roles/):** Create organizations, invite teammates,
  assign roles, and collaborate on annotations with comments and issues.
- **[Quality Control](https://docs.cvat.ai/docs/qa-analytics/manual-qa/):** Review annotations, flag issues, compare
  results across annotators with consensus, and run Ground Truth and Honeypot checks through the server API.
- **[Analytics](https://docs.cvat.ai/docs/administration/community/advanced/analytics/):** Monitor user activity,
  working time by job, events, and server logs with Grafana dashboards.
- **[Data Ops & Integrations](https://docs.cvat.ai/docs/dataset_management/export-datasets/):** Export/import in 20+
  formats (COCO, YOLO, Pascal VOC, KITTI, etc.), connect to cloud storage (S3, Azure, Google Cloud), and automate
  via REST API and Python SDK.

Advanced capabilities such as advanced project analytics, quality control UI, built-in auto-labeling with SAM 2
 and SAM 3, AI agents, SSO, and more are available in [CVAT Online](https://www.cvat.ai/pricing/cvat-online)

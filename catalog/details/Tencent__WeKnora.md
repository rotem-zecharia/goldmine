Open-source LLM knowledge platform: turn raw documents into a queryable RAG, an autonomous reasoning agent, and a self-maintaining Wiki.

## features

[**WeKnora**](https://weknora.weixin.qq.com) is an open-source, LLM-powered knowledge framework built for enterprise-grade document understanding, semantic retrieval, and autonomous reasoning.

It is organized around three core capabilities: **RAG-based Quick Q&A** for everyday lookups, a **ReAct Agent** that autonomously orchestrates retrieval, MCP tools and web search to handle complex multi-step tasks, and a brand-new **Wiki Mode** in which agents distill raw documents into a self-maintaining, interlinked markdown knowledge base with an interactive knowledge graph, complete with manual editing, revision history and one-click rollback. Knowledge curation is equally hands-on: a **tree-structured folder view** preserves the directory layout of uploads, and **chunk editing with revision history** lets retrieval chunks be edited, diffed and reverted like documents. Combined with multi-source ingestion (Feishu wiki / Feishu Drive / Notion / Yuque / RSS, and growing), **website embed widgets** for publishing agents to external sites, **scoped API keys with a principal model** for programmatic integrations, **multi-instance storage backends** per workspace for flexible data placement, 20+ LLM provider integrations, full Langfuse observability plus a **runtime task-queue dashboard with worker-pool governance**, **enterprise-ready multi-workspace RBAC** (4-tier role matrix + per-resource ownership + per-workspace audit log), and a fully self-hostable modular architecture, WeKnora turns scattered documents into a queryable, reasoning-capable, continuously evolving knowledge asset.

The framework supports auto-syncing knowledge from Feishu, Notion, and Yuque (more data sources coming soon), handles 10+ document formats including PDF, Word, images, and Excel, and can serve Q&A directly through IM channels like WeCom, Feishu, Slack, and Telegram. It is compatible with major LLM providers including OpenAI, DeepSeek, Qwen (Alibaba Cloud), Zhipu, Hunyuan, Gemini, MiniMax, NVIDIA, and Ollama. Its fully modular design allows swapping LLMs, vector databases, and storage backends, with support for local and private cloud deployment ensuring complete data sovereignty. WeKnora also integrates with **Langfuse** for comprehensive observability into agent reasoning, token usage, and pipeline tracing.


## ✨ Latest Updates

- **v0.7.2** — Launched the **official product documentation site** (VitePress; six sections, ~50 pages covering ~360 API endpoints and ~150 environment variables, with standalone Docker/Nginx deployment, quickstart sample data and a local MCP demo); **knowledge base folder tree** (upload paths stored as first-class data, browse/rename/re-file documents like a file manager); **chunk editing with revision history** (edit retrieval chunks in the UI, per-version diff and rollback, automatic reindexing, plus custom document metadata); **Wiki page revision history** (snapshots + line-level diff + one-click rollback + in-browser manual editing); **directly loadable file URLs** via `resource_urls=public` / `RESOURCE_URL_MODE` (third-party apps render images and files without a second authenticated proxy call); **Feishu Drive data source** and docx sync through the blocks API; batch document tagging; **MCP Server 1.1.x** (migrated to the mcp 2.x high-level API, official PyPI package `tencent-weknora-mcp`, new `create_knowledge_from_text` and `list_shared_knowledge_bases` for 29 tools total); AWS S3 default credential chain (IAM Role / IRSA); local HTML upload parsing; QQBot markdown replies; new PR CI checks for app / frontend / docreader / mcp-server. Plus large-scale router and `modelcontext` refactors, rerank and chunking quality work, and broad stability fixes. See [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md).
- **v0.7.1** — New **Yunzhijia (云之家) IM integration** (WebSocket + image messages + markdown replies); **Volcengine rerank** provider (with request batching) and **Zhipu AI web search** provider; **platform-scoped API keys** for control-pla

## requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tencent/WeKnora.git
cd WeKnora
cp .env.example .env   # Edit .env as needed, see comments in the file
docker compose pull     # Pull the latest images
docker compose up -d    # Start core services
```

Once started, visit **http://localhost** to get started.

> To use a local Ollama model, run `ollama serve > /dev/null 2>&1 &` first.

### 🔄 Upgrading

If you already have WeKnora running and downloaded a newer release:

```bash
# Set WEKNORA_VERSION in .env to the target release (e.g. 0.7.0), or keep latest
docker compose pull     # Pull images matching WEKNORA_VERSION
docker compose up -d    # Recreate containers with new images
```

> `docker compose up -d` alone reuses locally cached images and may leave the UI version out of sync with the release you downloaded.

### 🔧 Optional Services (Docker Compose Profiles)

Add `--profile` flags to enable additional components. Multiple profiles can be combined:

| Profile | Description | Command |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| _(default)_ | Core services | `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d` |
| `full` | All features | `docker compose --profile full pull && docker compose --profile full up -d` |
| `neo4j` | Knowledge Graph (Neo4j) | `docker compose --profile neo4j pull && docker compose --profile neo4j up -d` |
| `minio` | Object Storage (MinIO) | `docker compose --profile minio pull && docker compose --profile minio up -d` |
| `langfuse` | Tracing (Langfuse) | `docker compose --profile langfuse pull && docker compose --profile langfuse up -d` |

Combine profiles: `docker compose --profile neo4j --profile minio pull && docker compose --profile neo4j --profile minio up -d`

Stop services: `docker compose down`

### 🌐 Service URLs

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| Web UI | `http://localhost` |
| Backend API | `http://localhost:8080` |

## 🧭 Developer Guide

### ⚡ Fast Development Mode (Recommended)

If you need to frequently modify code, **you don't need to rebuild Docker images every time**! Use fast development mode:

```bash
# Start infrastructure
make dev-start

# Start backend (new terminal)
make dev-app

# Start frontend (new terminal)
make dev-frontend
```

**Development Advantages:**
- ✅ Frontend modifications auto hot-reload (no restart needed)
- ✅ Backend modifications quick restart (5-10 seconds, supports Air hot-reload)
- ✅ No need to rebuild Docker images
- ✅ Support IDE breakpoint debugging

## 🤝 Contributing

Welcome to submit [Issues](https://github.com/Tencent/WeKnora/issues) or Pull Requests.

**Process:** Fork → Create branch → Commit changes → Open PR

**Standards:** Format code with `gofmt`, follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (`feat:` / `fix:` / `docs:` / `test:` / `refactor:`)

### Validation

For a focused PR, validate the changed scope first:

```bash
git fetch origin main
git diff --check origin/main...HEAD
golangci-lint run --new-from-rev=origin/main ./...
go test ./path/to/changed/package -count=1
```

Run `gofmt` on changed Go files before committing. For frontend changes, run the relevant tests from `frontend/` and use `npm run type-check` when the change affects TypeScript or Vue components.

The full maintainer gate remains:

```bash
make fmt
make lint
make test
```

`make fmt` formats the entire Go repository, so run it only with a clean worktree and review the resulting diff. Some full-suite tests require local infrastructure or service configuration. If a full check fails for an unrelated baseline or environment reason, include the exact command and failure in the PR while still providing passing targeted tests for your change.

## 🔒 Security Notice

**Important:** Starting from v0.1.3, WeKnora includes login authentication functionality to enhance system security. For production deployments, we strongly recommend:

- Deploy WeKnora services in internal/private network environments rather than public internet
- Avoid exposing the service directly to public networks to prevent potential information leakage
- Configure proper firewall rules and access controls for your deployment environment
- Regularly update to the latest version for security patches and improvements

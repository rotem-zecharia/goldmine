Beads - A memory upgrade for your coding agent

## installation

```bash
# Install beads CLI (system-wide - don't clone this repo into your project)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gastownhall/beads/main/scripts/install.sh | bash

# Initialize in YOUR project
cd your-project
bd init

# Optional: refresh or install richer instructions for your agent
bd setup codex    # Codex CLI - installs skill, AGENTS.md guidance, and hooks
bd setup claude   # Claude Code - installs hooks/settings
bd setup factory  # Factory.ai Droid - creates/updates AGENTS.md
```

**Note:** Beads is a CLI tool you install once and use everywhere. You don't need to clone this repository into your project.

`bd init` creates or updates `AGENTS.md` by default so agents can discover the beads workflow, and also installs project Claude/Codex integrations unless you pass `--skip-agents` or `--stealth`. Use `bd setup --list` to see supported integrations, including `bd setup codex`, `bd setup factory`, `bd setup claude`, `bd setup mux`, `bd setup cursor`, and more. See [Agent and IDE setup](docs/getting-started/ide-setup.md).

Manual copy-paste is only for unsupported agents, existing projects where you cannot rerun `bd init`/`bd setup`, or custom instruction files. In those cases, run `bd onboard` and paste the printed snippet into the file your agent reads.

If your agent is not covered by `bd setup`, add this minimal `AGENTS.md` section:

```markdown
This project uses bd (beads) for issue tracking.

- Run `bd prime` for workflow context and command guidance.
- Use `bd ready`, `bd show <id>`, `bd update <id> --claim`, and `bd close <id>`.
- Use `bd remember "insight"` for persistent project memory; do not create MEMORY.md files.
- Do not use markdown TODO lists for task tracking.
```

## features

* **[Dolt](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt)-Powered:** Version-controlled SQL database with cell-level merge, native branching, and built-in sync via Dolt remotes.
* **Agent-Optimized:** JSON output, dependency tracking, and auto-ready task detection.
* **Zero Conflict:** Hash-based IDs (`bd-a1b2`) prevent merge collisions in multi-agent/multi-branch workflows.
* **Compaction:** Semantic "memory decay" summarizes old closed tasks to save context window.
* **Messaging:** Message issue type with threading (`--thread`), ephemeral lifecycle, and mail delegation.
* **Graph Links:** `relates-to`, `duplicates`, `supersedes`, and `replies-to` for knowledge graphs.

## tools

| Command | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `bd ready` | List tasks with no open blockers. |
| `bd create "Title" -p 0` | Create a P0 task. |
| `bd update <id> --claim` | Atomically claim a task (sets assignee + in_progress). |
| `bd dep add <child> <parent>` | Link tasks (blocks, related, parent-child). |
| `bd show <id>` | View task details and audit trail. |
| `bd prime` | Print agent workflow context and persistent memories. |
| `bd remember "insight"` | Store project memory that `bd prime` injects later. |

## 🔗 Hierarchy & Workflow

Beads supports hierarchical IDs for epics:

* `bd-a3f8` (Epic)
* `bd-a3f8.1` (Task)
* `bd-a3f8.1.1` (Sub-task)

**Stealth Mode:** Run `bd init --stealth` to use Beads locally without committing files to the main repo. Perfect for personal use on shared projects. See [Git-Free Usage](#-git-free-usage) below.

**Contributor vs Maintainer:** When working on open-source projects:

* **Contributors** (forked repos): Run `bd init --contributor` to route planning issues to a separate repo (e.g., `~/.beads-planning`). Keeps experimental work out of PRs.
* **Maintainers** (write access): Beads auto-detects maintainer role via SSH URLs or HTTPS with credentials. Only need `git config beads.role maintainer` if using GitHub HTTPS without credentials but you have write access.

## installation

This starts the app on `http://localhost:11345` and the VNC viewer on `http://localhost:54311`.


## Docker Compose (Standard)

### 1. Create a Project Directory

Create a directory for your Figranium installation and navigate into it:
```bash
mkdir figranium-server
cd figranium-server
```
### 2. Create docker-compose.yml

Create a docker-compose.yml file in your project directory:
```bash
services:
  figranium:
    image: ghcr.io/figranium/figranium:latest
    container_name: figranium
    ports:
      - "11345:11345"
      - "54311:54311"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
      - ./captures:/app/public/captures
    environment:
      - PORT=11345
      - SESSION_SECRET=your_secure_random_string
    restart: unless-stopped
```
### 3. Start with Docker Compose

Run the following command to start the application in detached mode:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```


## Git Clone (Multi-arch / ARM / Apple Silicon)

The easiest way to run Figranium on any architecture (including M1/M2/M3 Macs) is via Docker Compose.

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/figranium/figranium.git
cd figranium
```

2. Start the services:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

Visit `http://localhost:11345`.

> The first visit loads the login/setup screen. After you create the admin account and sign in, the dashboard replaces the login view and stays visible for as long as the session remains valid; returning users are redirected straight to the dashboard until they explicitly log out or the session expires.

## Session Secret

Set `SESSION_SECRET` before any run. A quick generator:

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

# Architecture Snapshot

## Figranite
At the core of Figranium lies **Figranite**, a high-performance, deterministic workflow interpreter designed for stateful browser automation. It is the project's primary execution kernel, responsible for transforming abstract block definitions into sentient-like browser behavior.

Key capabilities of **Figranite** include:
- **Stateful Execution:** Manages complex variables and loop contexts across blocks.
- **Human Physics Simulation:** Implements Bezier-curve cursor movements, randomized jitter, and fatigue-aware typing.
- **Stealth Integration:** Works in tandem with the Stealth Browser engine to bypass modern bot detection.
- **Recursive Logic:** Handles nested if/else, while, and foreach blocks with custom jump-map optimization.
- **Security-First:** Executes within a protected context with built-in SSRF and private network protection.


1. **Frontend**  
   - Vite with React (TypeScript) drives `/dashboard`, `/tasks`, `/settings`, `/executions`, and `/captures`.
   - The Settings screen is tabbed (`System`, `Data`, `Proxies`) and houses panels for API keys, user agents, layout, storage, and version info.
   - Components call `/api/*` endpoints through the Vite dev proxy (see `vite.config.mts`), sharing `APP_VERSION` via `src/utils/appInfo.ts`.

2. **Backend**  
   - `server.js` (Express) handles auth (`/api/auth`), task metadata, hooks into Playwright, and exposes `/api/settings/*` for runtime configuration.
   - Requirements: Node 18+ (LTS), Playwright bundled via `npm install`.
   - Storage is plain‑file: `data/` for proxies and allowlists, `public/captures` for visuals, and browser session cookies stored internally.

3. **Scripts & automation**  
   - `scripts/postinstall.js` runs when dependencies install (keep an eye if you customize).
   - `agent.js` (powered by the **Figranite Engine**), `headful.js`, and `scrape.js` expose specialized runners; the CLI binary `bin/cli.js` wires them for `npx figranium`.

4. **Code layout highlights**
   - `src/App.tsx` glues together routing, alerts, and the sidebar that links dashboards, tasks, and settings.
   - `src/components` houses reusable panels (API keys, storage, captures, proxies) that map directly to backend endpoints.
   - `server.js` embeds all HTTP handlers 

## configuration

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Signs session cookies. Required. | — |
| `ALLOWED_IPS` | Comma list for basic IP allowlisting. | none (open) |
| `TRUST_PROXY` | Honor `X-Forwarded-*` when behind a reverse proxy. | `0` |
| `ALLOW_PRIVATE_NETWORKS` | Allow scraping local/private IPs (SSRF risk). | `false` |
| `VITE_DEV_PORT` | Port for front-end dev server. | `5173` |
| `VITE_BACKEND_PORT` | Backend port for proxying + scripts. | `11345` |
| `DB_TYPE` | Optional database type overriding disk storage. Set to `postgres` to use PostgreSQL. | — |
| `DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST` | Hostname for the PostgreSQL database (required if DB_TYPE is postgres). | — |
| `DB_POSTGRESDB_PORT` | Port for the PostgreSQL database (required if DB_TYPE is postgres). | — |
| `DB_POSTGRESDB_USER` | Username for the PostgreSQL database (required if DB_TYPE is postgres). | — |
| `DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD` | Password for the PostgreSQL database (required if DB_TYPE is postgres). | — |
| `USE_CLOAK_ENGINE` | Set to `true` to run the browser engine on CloakBrowser (stealth-patched Chromium) instead of the default Playwright stealth stack. | `false` |
| `CLOAKBROWSER_LICENSE_KEY` | CloakBrowser license key for the latest binary (read natively by cloakbrowser; `npx cloakbrowser login` writes `~/.cloakbrowser/license.key`). Without a key the free legacy binary is used. | — |

Proxy rotation also respects `data/proxies.json` (see below), and `data/allowed_ips.json` works as an alternate allowlist format.

## Advanced Configuration

- `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` (or set `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH`) when using a shared Playwright installation.
- `NODE_ENV=production` enables the bundled `dist/` client and reduces console verbosity.
- `HOST=0.0.0.0` allows binding beyond localhost inside Docker containers, while `PORT` overrides the Express listen port (defaults to `11345`).
- Set `LOG_LEVEL` to `debug` if you need more Playwright or proxy diagnostics; this can also be a custom wrapper when running `node server.js`.
- **Headful mode:** the headful/visible browser binds to `54311`, so open that port alongside `11345` when running `headful.js` or other headful flows.

# UI Walkthrough

- **Dashboard** — quick stats, recent runs, and a “New Task” entry point (block or agent).
 - **Task Editor** — drag blocks (click, type, wait, scroll, press, JavaScript); toggle “Rotate Proxies”; schedule runs via the **Schedule** tab; run/stop tasks; inspect results with pins & logs.
 - **Captures** — review screenshots/recordings stored under `public/captures`; delete individually or refresh.
 - **Executions** — historical runs with detail drill-down and the ability to re-run or download results.
 - **Settings**
  - **System tab**: regenerate or copy API key, select user agent, adjust layout ratio, view/copy version (`VersionPanel`), and clear storage.
  - **Data tab**: manage captures and cookies.
  - **Proxies tab**: add/import proxies, set defaults, toggle rotation, and inspect host vs saved entries.

# CLI & Agent Mode

- Use `npx figranium` (or `npm run cli`) to launch the interactive CLI that shows tasks, status, and logs.
- Behind the scenes, `bin/cli.js` can invoke `agent.js`, `headful.js`, or `scrape.js` depending on the runtime mode (`--agent`, `--headful`, `--scrape`).
- Run `node agent.js --help` to see flags like `--task`, `--browser`, or `--version`. These runners share the same settings (API key, proxies, storage) as the web UI.
- When connecting via the API key, prefer `Authorization: Bearer <key>` so reverse proxies can normalize headers; the CLI also accepts a `--api-key` flag for scripted runs.

## tools

Figranium exposes a comprehensive REST API for integration with agents (like OpenClaw) or custom automation scripts. All endpoints are hosted locally, typically on port `11345`.

**Authentication:** 
If enabled, provide the `x-api-key` header or `Authorization: Bearer <key>`. For internal network use, this may be optional depending on your settings.


### Task Management API
*   **`GET /api/tasks`**: List all saved automation profiles.
*   **`POST /api/tasks`**: Create a new task profile.
*   **`PUT /api/tasks/:id`**: Update an existing task profile.
*   **`POST /api/tasks/:id/api`**: Execute a predefined task. Pass `{"variables": {}}` in the body to override execution variables dynamically.

### Scheduling API
*   **`GET /api/schedules`**: List all scheduled tasks and their status.
*   **`POST /api/schedules/:taskId`**: Create or update a schedule (supports visual config or raw cron).
*   **`DELETE /api/schedules/:taskId`**: Disable/remove a schedule.
*   **`GET /api/schedules/status/all`**: Get an overview of all active scheduled jobs.

### Execution & Logging API
*   **`GET /api/executions`**: Retrieve paginated logs of all past runs.
*   **`GET /api/executions/:id`**: View the exact steps, result JSON, and configuration state of a specific run.

### Data Management API
*   **`GET /api/data/captures`**: List generated screenshots, videos, and downloads.
*   **`DELETE /api/data/captures/:name`**: Delete a specific capture.
*   **`POST /api/clear-screenshots`**: Removes all files in `public/captures` and `data/recordings`.
*   **`POST /api/clear-cookies`**: Clears stored browser session cookies.

# Task Scripting Tips

- Use JavaScript blocks to scrape structured data:
  ```js
  return document.querySelectorAll('article').length;
  ```
- Keep CSS selectors narrow; the block-based editor surfaces `#`, `.`, and attribute hints.
- When running headlessly, toggle `headful.js` or `agent.js` depending on whether you need a visible browser for debugging.
- Set `task.variables` via the API to re-use generic workflows across multiple domains.

## Workflow Recipe

1. Design a task in the editor starting with a `goto` block and a `wait` block to give pages time to render.
2. Add conditional `javascript` blocks to test for specific DOM elements; use the retry/timer controls per block.
3. Attach `extract` (JSON output) or `screenshot` actions before submitting so you can inspect results in the Captures tab.
4. Toggle “Rotate Proxies” if you need egress diversity and pick a default proxy on Settings → Proxies.
5. Use the **Schedule** tab to set up automated runs (e.g., every day at 9 AM or every 15 minutes).
6. Save the task, pin results you care about, and use the `POST /tasks/:id/api` endpoint with variables like `{"variables":{"query":"books"}}` to run it from automation tools.

# Task Scheduling

Figranium includes a built-in scheduler that handles automated task execution without requiring external cron jobs or triggers.

- **Visual Mode**: Easily configure periodic runs (every X minutes), hourly, daily, weekly (select specific days), or monthly runs.
- **Advanced Mode**: Use standard 5-field cron expressions (`* * * * *`) for complex schedules.
- **Persistence**: Schedules are stored within the task metadata and persist across server restarts.
- **Monitoring**: The "Next Run" and "Last Run" status (including duration) are visible directly in the Task Editor's Schedule tab.

# Testing & Validation

- Run `npm run build` before packaging for production; the `dist/` folder contains the compiled assets.
- Backend logging writes to the console; capture output from `server.js` for debugging proxies, authentication, or Playwright failures.
- Playwright logs are visible in the running Node process and under `node_modules/.cache` when using the CLI.

# Troubleshooting

- **“Session expired”** in the UI: confirm `SESSION_SECRET` is consistent and cookies aren’t blocked by your browser.
- **Proxy import fails**: inspect `data/proxies.json` for 

## limitations

- [x] **Settings shortcuts** — the System tab already exposes API key regeneration, user agent selection, and layout preferences so operators can tune them without leaving the UI.
- [x] **Storage cleanup** — the Settings data tab lets you clear captures and cookies, and the backend exposes `/api/clear-screenshots` and `/api/clear-cookies`.
- [x] **IP rotation tooling** — build a settings workflow for importing proxies and automatically rotating them.
- [x] **API key workflow** — the API key panel already supports regenerating and copying keys via `/api/settings/api-key`, so secure API access is ready without extra setup.
- [x] **Task proxy rotation toggle** — the “Rotate Proxies” option in each task ties into the Settings rotation controls, enabling rotation per execution.
- [x] **Spatial editor transition** — transition to a spatial editor like that of activepieces (top priority).
- [ ] **Action key combos** — add modifier shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl+Click, Shift+Scroll) so tasks can more closely mirror real user interactions.
- [ ] **Click-and-drag block** — add an action that does drag gestures (selecting text, moving items) so tasks can simulate click-and-drag flows.
- [x] **Recording controls** — Task editor now exposes a “Disable automated recording” switch in the general settings panel so workflows can skip video capture on a per-task basis.
- [x] **File downloads** — add explicit support for agent tasks to download files (PDFs, CSVs, etc.) directly from target pages, then surface those downloads in the UI so users can preview or export them without sifting through captures.
- [x] **Stateless mode** — Tasks now have a “Stateless execution” toggle alongside the recording controls so each run starts with no cookies or local storage, ensuring nothing persists between executions for that workflow.
- [ ] **Adblocking filters** — add controls so execution contexts can enable built-in ad/malware filtering (e.g., via hosts file overrides or request blocking) to reduce noise on sensitive sites.
- [ ] **Extraction response mode** — add a Settings switch so users can choose whether the API returns HTML+data (for debugging) or data-only payloads when extraction scripts run.
- [ ] **Folder organization** — group tasks, assets, and captures into named folders so operators can browse, filter, and download collections per workflow.
- [ ] **Stable capture retention** — add filtering, pinning, and archiving in captures tab so teams can keep compliance records.
- [ ] **Workspace templates** — allow saving and sharing workspace presets (layout + default proxies/agents) so new team members can onboard with pre-configured setups.
- [ ] **Geo-targeted exits** — allow choosing proxy regions for tasks so you can pin the apparent location before running a job.
- [x] **Complete anti-detection coverage** — follow browserscan.net's anti-detection checklist (fingerprints, headers, fonts, WebRTC, etc.) so automated runs mimic real browsers across task executions.
- [ ] **Session recording redaction** — add toggles to redact sensitive fields (passwords, credit cards) from recordings/logs before storing them.
- [ ] **Two-factor authentication** — add optional TOTP/second-factor support to Settings/Auth so operators can lock down the UI with 2FA.
- [ ] **Automatic self-healing selectors** — add selector fallback and recovery logic so tasks can repair broken locators after layout changes without manual intervention.
- [ ] **AI-assisted fixing** — add an “AI auto-fix” helper that suggests layout, selector, and proxy tweaks after failed runs, letting teams approve or discard the proposed changes without switching contexts.
- [ ] **Companion app** — build a lightweight companion app that mirrors critical dashboard notifications (failures, capture completions, proxy issues) so operators can stay informed without opening the full UI.
- [x] **Community presets hub** — build a marketplace where users can publish task/workspace presets, browse and download others’ sub
